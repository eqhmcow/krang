Krang has been tested on a Gentoo 1.4.3 install.  Before you install
Krang, you will need to install MySQL 4 and Perl 5.8:

emerge mysql
emerge perl

Since you will be building Krang from source (it *is* Gentoo after
all), all other dependencies should be taken care of by this point.

NOTE:

At this time, krang_install is somewhat broken with respects to
Gentoo: It will successfully install Krang, but will fail with an ugly
error message when it tries to use chkconfig to install init scripts.

What this mean is this: Ignore the error message, krang has installed.
However, it will not start up on boot - for the time being, you will
need to do that manually.
