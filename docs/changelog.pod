=head1 Krang Changelog

This document contains a list of changes for each release of Krang.

=head2 v1.020 - Under Development

=over

=item *

Fixed a bug where clicking Publish on the Edit Media screen didn't
save changes. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where a story that failed to publish would still get a
'published' log entry.  [Sam]

=item *

Added support for Fedora Core 2. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed problem determining C<KRANG_ROOT> on Fedora Core 2 in all
Krang scripts. [Sam]

=back

=head2 v1.019 - Jun 04, 2004

=over

=item *

Fixed bug where C<krang_export> could only write output in directories
where C<KrangUser> had write permissions.  The output file is now
opened before su'ing to C<KrangUser>. [Sam]

=item *

Removed support for C<--append> from C<krang_export>.  This option was
never, to my knowledge, used and it didn't work after the permissions
fix above.  [Sam]

=item *

Changed the schema for the Krang::User XML format to make the new
'hidden' field optional.  This allows data files from pre-v1.017 Krang
to load in later Krangs. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed the v1.018 upgrade module to successfully upgrade instances from
v1.016 and older.  Also made changes to allow repeated runs of the
upgrade module to succeed even if the upgrade stops part way through.
[Sam]

=item *

Changed C<krang_upgrade> to wait till the upgrade is complete before
updating Krang's version number.  This means that failed upgrades can
be re-run and the same upgrade modules will be run again. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed Gentoo Platform tests so that any version of Gentoo 1.4.x now 
works. [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug in the error-handling section of Krang::Publisher that was
hiding the real cause of errors during publish.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed broken --republish_only flag in bin/krang_publish. [Peter]

=item *

Changed the default of Krang::ElementClass::Date so that dates are updated 
when the default() method is called and not when new() is called.


=item *

Made Krang::Sotry::find(published=>1) work with stories that had a published 
version of 1/0 instead of NOT NULL / NULL.

=item *

Fixed Krang::XML::Writer to allow raw tabs in XML without Base64
encoding. [Sam]

=item *

Added a workaround for a very strange seg-fault bug.  [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where aftrer upgrading to v1.018 old users don't show up in
the User Admin list screen. [Sam]

=item *

Changed Krang::Site so that only the site's URL is required to be
unique.  Requiring all four fields to be unique, while seemingly
sensible, causes numerous problems during data imports.  If necessary
we could add these checks back in at the UI level in Krang::CGI::Site.
[Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::Contrib's full_name() that would add ", " to the
end of the name when the contributor had an empty suffix. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::Publisher where no file would be written if the
story's output contained only whitespace or was empty. [Sam]

=item *

Bugfix related to the publish changes made in 1.017 - assets linked to
a story being previewed from an edit interface are now marked
properly.  Media objects are now marked properly when previewed. [Peter]

=item *

Replaced Archive::Tar in Krag::DataSet->new with the system 'tar' for a 50x 
speedup in untaring. [Rudy]

=item *

Removed code from Krang::Contrib that disallowed stories with existing
historical contrib-contrib_type pairs to preview/publish. [Matt]

=back

=head2 v1.018 - May 10, 2004

=over

=item *

Fixed permissions error during upgrade backup creation. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where permissions were not being applied to the Find Link
and Active list screens. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::Group which caused root-category permisssions to
be randomized during rebuild_category_cache().  [Sam]

=item *

Added C<--no-backup> option to C<krang_upgrade>. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug in C<bin/krang_publish> where unknown errors during story
publish would trigger an exit without any kind of useful message.  The
error is now printed to STDERR. [Peter]

=item *

Changed Krang to log and drop elements which exceed the maximum
allowed by their parent element.  This mirrors the behavior for
elements with illegal class names.  This allows for an easier element
set development process at the risk of possible data loss, which is
somewhat mitigated by the built in revision system. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed Krang::ElementLibrary to return a sorted list from top_levels().
This results in a sorted list or article types in the UI.  [Sam]

=item *

Added a new hidden user called 'system' which is now used by
Krang::Script.  This means you can now delete the 'admin' user with
impunity. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel::publish_check() was not
being checked by Krang::Schedule.  Stories that are marked to not be
published by the scheduler will now have their wishes respected.
[Peter]

=item *

Fixed bug where contributors created by C<krang_import> weren't
searchable in the UI unless they had first, middle and last
names. [Sam]

=item *

Added code to generate HTML documentation for the scripts in
F<bin/>. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where previewing/publishing zero-length stories caused an
error.  [Peter]

=back

=head2 v1.017 - April 29, 2004

=over

=item *

Fixed a bug where C<tmpl_include> calls in templates weren't correctly
searching the category tree in all cases. [Matt]

=item *

Modified Krang::Widget::category_chooser() to take into account
category permissions when building the category chooser.  Also took
advantage of the multiple-root support in HTML::PopupTreeSelect 1.4 to
remove to empty root node from the widget.  [Sam]

=item *

Upgraded HTML::PopupTreeSelect to the latest released version,
1.4. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::Group where the category permissions cache
wasn't being correctly rebuilt after group changes were saved. [Sam]

=item *

Added filesystem sanity checks to the Publish checks - If the
story/media object being tested does not exist on the filesystem in
all locations that it should, it's flagged for output, regardless of
versioning.  Also cleaned up some unneeded API cruft.  [Peter]

=item *

Large changes to the publishing engine.  When publishing/previewing a
story, Krang::Publisher will now check all related stories/media to
see if the most recent version of each object has been
published/previewed before.  If so, the object will not be
published/previewed again.  The chosen story/media object will always
be published/previewed.  This is only default behavior in the UI,
scheduled publish jobs and bin/krang_publisher still publish all
content.  Additional parameters have been added to the
Krang::Publisher API to support this functionality, see
L<Krang::Publisher> for more information.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::Contrib where importing a contributor with no
first name or no last name would duplicate the contributor if it
already existed instead of updating. [Sam]

=item *

Added the C<--skip> option to C<krang_import> which exposes the
existing Krang::DataSet::import_all() C<skip_classes> option from the
command-line. [Sam]

=item *

Removed "Delete Checked" button from List Admin screen.  Lists cannot
be deleted. [Sam]

=item *

Added Krang::Story->preview_version(), Krang::Media->preview_version
and Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel->force_republish() in anticipation
of forthcoming improvements to the publishing system. [Peter]


=item *

Upgraded XML::Validator::Schema to the latest release, 1.06. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed Krang::Story->preview_path() to use the submitted category
argument.  This was keeping preview from writing out content to
multiple sites. [Peter]

=item *

Added password-length check to My Preferences, enforcing the
6-character minimum length on passwords that exists everywhere else in
the UI.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed error reporting in the publish process - error messages are
displayed in a more user-friendly fashion.[Peter]

=item *

Fixed Krang::ElementClass->publish() to trap errors thrown by
HTML::Template::Expr->output(), and fixed Krang::CGI::Publisher to
properly report errors and not try to redirect users when failures
occur in preview.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed krang_ftpd to setup higher file and memory limits.  These limits
were preventing the FTP server from operating on some systems. [Sam]

=back

=head2 v1.016 - April 20, 2004

=over

=item *

Fixed Krang::DB to always turn on mysql_auto_reconnect (it was already
on by default under mod_perl).  This should prevent the schedule
daemon from periodically dying when a database connections times out.
[Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::ElementClass which would fail to setup
"is_$element" template vars if "$element" wasn't used as a template
var itself. [Matt]

=item *

Changed site editor to allow colons so that port numbers can be
specified for preview URLs. [Perrin]

=item *

Synchronized Devel-StackTrace with latest from CPAN, so that we are
now using the standard release. [Perrin]

=item *

t/group.t now uses Krang::Test::Content to generate random content,
rather than bin/krang_floodfill. [Peter]

=item *

More comprehensive FreeBSD support.  Krang now works on FreeBSD 4.9
and 5.2.1, and should work on versions between and previous to that
(as long as the appropriate dependencies are in place).  [Peter]

=item *

ftpserver.t now uses Krang::Test::Content.  Simplifies cleanup, and
fixes a bug where ftpserver tests would fail if krang_install used the
--AdminPassword argument (a user is now created for the purposes of
testing). [Peter]

=item *

Added Krang::User creation/destruction to Krang::Test::Content -
furthering the goal that Krang::Test::Content should be able to create
all parts of a site randomly, and clean up everything properly at the
end. [Peter]

=item *

Modified Krang::Contrib::deserialize_xml() to create contributor types
as needed.  [Sam]

=item *

Changed Krang::ElementClass::Date to store and load data in XML using
an ISO-8601 date-time format. Also added missing template_data()
method.  [Sam]

=item *

Added support for Debian. [Jason Purdy]

=item *

Fixed bug where clicking on a media link in the element editor would
open a new window every time. [Sam]

=item *

Moved code to run tests from Makefile into bin/krang_test.  This
allows krang_install to affect which Perl binary runs the tests. It
also helps with BSD portability since the test target didn't work with
BSD make. [Sam]

=back

=head2 v1.015 - April 8, 2004

=over

=item *

Added a message to remind users that they must create a site before
adding stories, media or templates. [Sam]

=item *

Added initial support for FreeBSD!  Currently it only supports FreeBSD
5.2.1 with GNU make (gmake) installed, as that was the only available
testable environment.  Would be nice if someone with more experience
in BSD Makefiles could get Krang's Makefiles to work with BSD make.
There should be nothing keeping Krang from working with earlier
versions of FreeBSD, but that will require someone to pick up the BSD
ball and run with it.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed site editor to check that URLs don't have paths attached to them
and that paths are obsolute. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed krang_upgrade to use Krang::Platform.  Added a new method to
Krang::Platform, post_upgrade_message(). [Sam]

=item *

Upgraded XML-Writer, HTML-Parser, and Tar-Archive to get rid of warnings.
[Perrin]

=item *

Upgraded mod_perl and apache to latest releases. [Perrin]

=item *

Fixed the behavior of Krang::Publisher->preview_story().  Following
the original spec, it now writes the story out to all categories in
the preview path.  Fixed Krang::Story->preview_path as well. [Peter]

=item *

Upgraded Test::Harness to 2.40 to enable warnings during tests.  Fixed
a number of warnings in the test files. [Perrin] [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where schedule tests would fail frequently due to
krang_schedulectl leaving bad PID files around.  Also made the
schedule tests quiet unless an error occurs. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where using a category_trail_loop in a category element
template produced an ISE. [Sam]

=item *

Added support for Fedora Core 1. [Perrin Harkins]

=item *

Moved Krang user/group creation from krang_install to Krang::Platform.
This can now be overridden on a platform-by-platform basis. [Peter]

=item *

Created Krang::Platform->find_bin().  Use of this sub now needs to be
propegated throughout krang_install along with Krang::Platform and its
derivatives - it searches $PATH for the full path for the executable
you're trying to run. [Peter]



=item *

Moved the final installation message out of bin/krang_install, created
Krang::Platform->post_install_message() that generates the same output.
This can now be overridden & extended on a platform-specific basis. [Peter]

=item *

Split the various checks out of Krang::Platform->verify_dependencies().
This will simplify ports to other platforms, as individual checks can
now be overridden, rather than the entire sub. [Peter]

=item *

Added new default scheduled job to analyze DB tables nightly.  This
greatly improves performance for large databases. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where default scheduled jobs (tmp cleaner and session
expiration) weren't being run for new installations. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed krang_createdb to stop after the first failed system
call. [Scott Lanning]

=item *

Added enhanced cache debugging code and a last-resort check in an
Apache log_handler to make sure the cache is off at the end of the
request. [Sam]

=item *

Moved setup of /etc/init.d link from krang_install into the Redhat
platform modules' finish_installation() methods.  This should allow
the Gentoo and Debian ports to proceed. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed build and installation system to work with a Perl that isn't
called 'perl' and in your path.  So, for example, if you've got a
binary called 'perl5.8.0' you can build Krang with it and install with
it. [Sam]

=item *

Added initial support for Gentoo 1.4.3. [Peter]

=item *

Updated porting.pod with steps that might really work. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where an error occuring during preview triggered a
Krang::Cache error which corrupted the display. [Sam]

=item *

Improved error message generated when InstanceElementSet is set to an
element set that isn't installed. [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a ton of whitespace in module source files which was breaking
the POD output. [Peter]

=back

=head2 v1.014 - March 31, 2004

=over

=item *

First public release of Krang!
