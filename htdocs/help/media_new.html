<h2>New Media</h2>
<p>
The New Media page is used to upload or create media, such as images (.jpg, .gif) and video, for use in your stories.  Any media that you want to display with your story has to be uploaded or created in Krang. Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required fields and must be entered.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Type:</b> Each media file has a Type. This is set by the CMS on creation of new media and is not an editable field. If you selected the incorrect Media Type, you will need to return to 'New Media.' Media Type selection determines the attributes available to the media.</li>
<li><b>Title:</b> Required field used to give your image a unique name.</li>
<li><b>Site/Categories:</b>	  Required field used to designate the URL of the site or category where you want to upload your media. Clicking the <i>Choose</i> button will launch a menu tree where you can find the correct category. From the menu tree click <i>OK</i> to accept your choice or <i>Cancel</i> to return to the New Media page.</li>
<li><b>Upload File:</b>  Click on <i>Browse</i> to find an image or other media you would like to upload. This is a required field for binary types; otherwise you may leave it blank, and Krang will attempt to create an empty file named after your Title.</li>

After entering in the above information choose one of the buttons at the bottom of the page.

<ul>

<li><b>Cancel:</b> Click on <i>Cancel</i> to discard your new media.<li>
<li><b>Create:</b> Click on <i>Create</i> to save your media, publish it to preview, and go to the Edit Media screen.</li>

</ul>
