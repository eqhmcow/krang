<h2>My Alerts</h2>
<p>
You can alert fellow users of your CMS to certain actions by setting up an Alert. Alerts will send an email to a user if the action specified occurs. The different actions that alerts can be set for are:
</p>

<ul
<li>Check In</li>
<li>Check Out</li>
<li>Move To</li>
<li>New </li>
<li>Publish</li>
<li>Save</li>
</ul>

<p>
An alert for one of these actions can be set for specific Story or Media objects, for all Story or Media objects within a certain category, or for every object in the system (including templates). To set up a new Alert, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Select an Action from the dropdown list.</li>
<li>If you wish to limit the alert to a specific Story/Media object, select the Object Type & Object ID.
<li>If you wish to limit the alert to Story/Media objects beneath a certain category, choose a Site/Category.</li>
<li>If you wish to limit the alert to Stories that are moved to a given desk, select a Desk.</li>
<li>Click on <i>Add Alert.</li>
</ol>

<p>
To delete, edit, or create new alerts at any time, click on <i>My Alerts</i> in the left navigation.
