The New Template page is used to create new templates. Templates format the content in your CMS with HTML and other formatting languages.<br><br>

To create a new template, enter the following fields:<br><br>

<b>Element:</b> Select an element from the drop-down. The element should be related to the template. This is an optional field: you can create a template without selecting an element.<br>
<b>Filename:</b> Name your template file. This field is not required if you upload a template file.<br>
<b>Site/Category:</b>	This is a required field used to designate the URL of the site or category where you want to upload/create your template. Clicking the Choose button will launch a menu tree where you can find the correct category. From the menu tree click <i>OK</i> to accept your choice or <i>Cancel</i> to return to the New Template page.<br>
<b>Upload File:</b> Click on <i>Browse</i> to find a file on your computer. This is not required, as the template can be created directly in the CMS (see <i>Content</i>).<br>
<b>Content:</b> You can create your template directly in the CMS. Use this text box for template code.<br>
<b>Test:</b> Check this box and you can test the template without deploying it and affecting stories being published.<br><br>

After entering in the above information click on one of the Buttons at the bottom of the page. <i>Cancel</i> will discard your new template. <i>Save &amp Stay</i> will save your template and refresh the current page. <i>Save</i> will save your template and send you to your Workspace.<br><br><i>Deploy</i> will deploy the template to production. It is suggested that you test with your template before deploying.<br><br>
