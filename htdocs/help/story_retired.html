<h2>Archived Stories - Advanced/Simple</h2>

<p>
Use Archived Stories, to search Krang for archived stories. By using
search terms and keywords, you can run specific searches for
individual or multiple stories.
</p>

<p>
There are two search modes:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Simple:</b> The default search is very simple: just enter a
title, URL or keyword and click <i>Search</i>. For a complete list of
Stories, leave the space blank and click <i>Search</i>.</li>

<li><b>Advanced:</b> This search allows you to be more specific about
the Story you're trying to find. Fill in any or all of the fields and
click <i>Search</I>. To restart your search with a fresh page, click
<i>Clear</i>.<br/>

When searching by Story ID, you may also find live or trashed stories.
For live stories the status column will indicate 'Live', for trashed
stories, 'Trash'.

</li>

</ul>

<p>
After completing your Search and finding the Story you are looking
for, you can View, Copy, Unarchive or Delete the Story (depending on
your permission set).
</p>

<p>
If you didn't find what you are looking for, you may click <i>Search
in Live</i> to start the same search in live Krang.
