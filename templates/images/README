These files are processed by Krang::Skin to produce the images in
htdocs/images.  They undergo a conversion which replaces transparent
sections with the configured background color, red with light_color,
green with bright_color and blue with dark_color.  

You can also blend the colors and the result will be a blend between
the configured colors.  For example, arrow-asc.gif blends from
light_color to dark_color by blending red and blue in the source
image.
