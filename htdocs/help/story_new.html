<h2>New Story</h2>

<p>
Within Krang, all written content is considered a Story. Whether it's a feature article or your web site's Homepage, using this tool will get you started creating new content.
</p>

<p>
Each Story that is created in Krang will have unique elements and specific features that you pick and choose from as you build your Story.
</p>

<p>
The first items associated with a Story are the properties that you select/enter on the 'New Story' page.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Type:</b> Type refers to your Story Type. Select the type of Story you'd like to create, such as Feature Article. Story Type is a required field.</li>
<li><b>Title:</b> This is the Title of your Story. Depending on the Story Type it may appear directly in the output. The Title is a required field.</li>
<li><b>Slug:</b> The slug is a one-word identifier used as the last part of the Story's URI, and the directory in which the story resides.  Some Story Types require a slug. Essentially, this is the story's filename and will appear in the URL of the page. The slug must be unique.</li>
<li><b>Cover Date:</b> When creating a New Story, select a Cover Date. The cover Date defaults to the current date and time, but it can be modified to a future or previous date. The cover date is a required field and may appear on some Story Types directly in the URL or the page.</li>
<li><b>Site/Category:</b> Every Story must be located in a site and category. Clicking the <i>Choose</i> button will launch a menu tree where you can find the correct category. From the menu tree click <i>OK</i> to accept your choice and close the function or <i>Cancel</i> to return to the New Story page.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After the above information is entered, click on <i>Create</i>, this will take you to the next step in Creating a New Story.
</p>

<p>
<i>Reset</i> and <i>Cancel</i> are also available. Resetting will delete all text from the text boxes on this page. Cancelling will return you to My Workspace and not Save any of the information entered.
