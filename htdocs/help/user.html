<h2>User Management</h2>

<p>
This is where you create user accounts and establish permission levels. A user's permission set is determined by his or her association to a specific permission Group. For example, if you want user Sally Jones to be allowed to edit media, you'll go to her User Profile page and enter her into a Group that has Media editing permissions.
</p>

<p>
Within the User Management screen, you can also:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Search: </b>Searches users by last name or first name. Do a blank search to list all users.</li>
<li><b>Add:</b> Click <i>Add a User</i> to create a new user account. It brings you to the User Profile page. Enter the requested information and then click <i>Save</i> at the bottom of the page. </li>
<li><b>Edit: </b>Click <i>Edit</i> to modify a person's User Profile.  	</li>
<li><b>Delete: </b>To delete a user account, check the box, scroll to the bottom of the page and click the <i>Delete Checked</i> button.</li>
</ul>
