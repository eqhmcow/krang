Platform for RedHat Enterprise Linux, ES5 is mostly copied from 
the ES4 platform.

Before you install Krang you'll need to install MySQL 4.  You can 
find the MySQL 4 RPMs here:

  http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html

Install the server, client, devel and shared RPMs.  After that you
should be ready to run krang_install.  See INSTALL for details.

NOTE: On RHEL ES5 Krang is setup to start on boot, via a link to
bin/krang_ctl placed in /etc/init.d and activated using chkconfig.

If you want to build Krang from a source distribution (ex:
krang-3.00-src.tar.gz), you'll need the following RPMs installed.
You can install them via up2date or yum:

   gcc
   cpp
   binutils
   glibc-kernheaders
   zlib-devel
   mysql-devel
   expat-devel
   libjpeg-devel
   giflib-devel
   libpng-devel
