The desks structure allows you and other PIRT CMS users to share and exchange Stories.<br><br>

After you create and save a new Story, it resides on your Workspace by default. You can then check it into a desk to make it accessible to other users in your CMS. Once a user from one desk edits and approves the Story, he or she will move it to the next desk and the process will repeat until the Story is ready to be published.<br><br>

A desk looks and operates a lot like your Workspace -- it's just a common space version. If a media resides on the "Art Desk," as an example, any user who has access to the "Art Desk" will have access to the media, though only one at a time can edit it.<br><br>

The following functions are available in the Desk Editor:<br><br>

<b>Preview:</b> Click on the hyperlinked file name. A new window will open to preview the Story.<br>
<b>Publish:</b> To publish a Story file, click on the <i>Publish</i> button. Publishing will put the file on the Internet.<br>
<b>Check Out:</b>	To edit the Story, click on <i>Check Out</i>. Other users will not be able to edit the file while you have it checked out. <br>
<b>Move:</b> Select another desk from the drop-down menu and click <i>Move</i>.<br>
<b>Log:</b> Click on <i>Log</i> to view past actions performed by users of the PIRT CMS.<br>
<b>View:</b> In read-only mode, click <i>View</i> to view the properties and content of the Story in question.<br>
<b>Edit:</b> Click on edit to modify your Story.<br><br>

<span class="helpnote">*Depending on the permissions assigned to you, you may or may not have access to all functions.</span><br><br>
