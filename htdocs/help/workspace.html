<span class="helptitle">My Workspace</span><br><br>
My Workspace is your personal space within the PIRT CMS. This is a space that only you as a 'logged in user' can access, it is your home base. This is where you store files that you are working on. These files can be Stories, Media or Templates.<br><br>

Click on <i>My Workspace</i> in the upper left hand corner to return to this screen at any time.<br><br>

If you want to edit a file, you can Check Out the file and click on Edit from 'My Workspace'. Additionally, depending on your permissions you may be able to Edit from other areas of the CMS.<br><br>
<span class="helpsub">Check In/Check Out</span><br>
The PIRT CMS is a Check In/Check Out system. In other words, you must Check Out a file in order to edit it; you must Check In a file for another user to work on the same file.<br><br>

All files that a user has Checked Out will appear on 'My Workspace.'<br><br>

There are three different types of files in the PIRT CMS. They are<br><br>

1)	Media
2)	Stories
3)	Templates
<br><br>
<span class="helpnote">*Depending on the permissions assigned to you, you may or may not have access to all types of files.</span><br><br>

When you Check In or Check Out a Story, the Story originates either from a Search result or from a <a href="desk.html" class="helplink">Desk</a>. Stories are the only types of files that use Desks, neither Media nor Templates do not. These files are either on a user's 'My Workspace' or they are Checked In to the system.<br><br>

When a file appears on 'My Workspace' the following functions are available:<br><br>
