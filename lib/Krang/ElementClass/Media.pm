Krang::ElementClass::Media - media element class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   $class = pkg('ElementClass::Media')->new(name => "media");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a simple wrapper around TopLevel that media elements
can use to identify themselves.

=head1 INTERFACE

All the normal L<Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel> attributes and methods are available.

In addition, ElementClass::Media provides:

An element_class_name method that returns the name of the first toplevel 
element that inherits from ElementClass::Media.

A publish method that is called when a Media object is published.

An unpublish method that is called when a Media object is deleted.

=cut


=item element_class_name()

Returns the name of the first toplevel element that inherits from ElementClass::Media

=cut

    return $name;
}

Called when a media object is published

    # now call each child element's publish() method.  In stories, this "element 
    # walk" is done when the top-level publish() calls fill_template(), which 
    # calls each child element's publish() method gathering their returned html 
    # into its template vars, and they in turn take care of calling their kids' 
    # publish methods to build their html.
    #
    # since we're not building up a structure of template params, here we'll 
    # simply call each child's publish method for their side effects,ignoring 
    # their return values.
    
    # You must override the publish() method of child elements which are 
    # containers (have children of their own) or else they will not just 
    # harmlessly return their data(), instead the publish() methods of the 
    # containers will try to "do the story thing" i.e. fall back to the 
    # ElementClass::publish() method which (among other things) calls 
    # find_template() which dies in turn dies when one is not found.
