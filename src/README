This directory contains the files necessary to re-build Krang's
required external sub-systems and libraries from source.  These
external assets currently include:

        1. Apache/mod_perl web server
        2. Open source Perl modules

It is not usually necessary to rebuild from source, as all these
assets are provided in compiled form in the /krang/apache/ and
/krang/lib/ directories, respectively.  The files in this directory
are provided only in the case of some unforseen necessity, such as
disaster recovery or migration to a new operating system or hardware
architecture.

It is expected that as new Perl modules or other external resources
are added, their tarballed source trees will be added to this
directory.

A list of all CPAN Perl modules, their versions and licenses is kept
in docs/cpan_inventory.pod.  If you add a module here, please update
that file.
