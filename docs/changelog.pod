This document contains a list of changes for each release of Krang.

=head2 3.16 (in development)

=over

=item *

Fixing bug where messages during publish were getting lost [Michael
Peters]

=item * 

Allowed multiple schedulers to run without processing the same
schedules. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added 4 flags to L<Krang::ElementClass::CategoryLink> implementing a
'conditional publishing behavor' for stories having CategoryLinks.
If this behavior is set via any 4 flags, the story will be published
if and only if a story/media living in/below the category that has
been set in the CategoryLink has has been modified since it's last
publishing. [Bodo Schulze]

=back

=head2 3.15 - November, 16 2011

=over

=item *

Publishing through the UI no longer locks the session while the publishing
is happening. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Adding C<--no-ssl-symlinks> option to Krang upgrade to skip rebuilding
the SSL cert symlinks. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added a new C<session_id> method to L<Krang::Session> to make it really
easy to determine the current session's ID. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed story_find help text. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added F<docs/feature_history> to document new features and functional
enhancements from a user perspective. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Put back session locking because without it there are race conditions
when we deal with multiple windows and nested data structures in the
sessions. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Allow IFRAME tags in Xinha. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Auto-preview media objects that are directly uploaded to a story so
that they will already be ready when the story itself is previewed.
[Michael Peters]

=item *

C<Krang.Ajax.update()> javascript function can now take a function as
the value of C<target> or C<to_top> to be executed on-demand after the
actual request is done. [Michael Peters]

=item *

The second argument to the SQL 'limit' clause must no be a negative
number.  Instead use a very high positive number in the find() method
of backend modules. See
http://http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/select.html. [Bodo
Schulze]

=item *

Added 'contribs' param to create_story() and create_media() in
L<Krang::Test::Content>. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed upgrade module V3_10 in tags 3.10 - 3.14 and on the trunk. [Bodo
Schulze]

=item *

Fixed problem with F<bin/krang_apachectl> not stopping an running Krang
in Offline Mode [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed problem with ISEs resulting from POST requests causing problems with
the ErrorHandler and not giving the same response as GET ISEs. [Michael
Peters]

=item * 

Changed multi-window feature to use a single session per-login instead
of using a different session for each window. [Michael Peters]

=item * 

Fixed ISE (regression) that occurs when you try an advanced search for
retired stories. [Michael Peters]

=item *

caught and shown to the user. [Michael Peters]

=back

=head2 3.14 - June, 23 2011

=over

=item *

Reset environment variables set by L<ExtUtils::MakeMaker> and
L<Module::Build> to get a clean start. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added script F<bin/krang_storable_freezethaw> to help migrating between
32bit and 64bit architectures. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added C<IgnorePreviewRelatedStoryAssets> and
C<IgnorePreviewRelatedMediaAssets> configuration directives so that
instances can choose to ignore publishing related assets during
preview. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Removed the need for F<bin/krang_addon_dist> to have a valid F<krang.conf>
since it doesn't actually use anything in that. This allows for
automating the building of a package from a Krang svn checkout that is
built. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed FTP download of templates with UTF8 characters in binary mode.
[Brad Oaks]

=item *

Editing and saving an existing category will now convert a story with
a duplicate url into a category index. This check already happens when
creating a new category.  [Brad Oaks]

=item *

The Find Story button for a Lead In element of a story now works in the
Chrome browser.  [Brad Oaks]

=item * 

When Bulk Editting something with a C<< <p> >> tag as a separator,
we now strip off any remaining stray closing C<< </p> >> tags as
well. [Michael Peters]

=item *

When someone steals a story or template from a user, give a more
descriptive error message including the name of the person who stole
it. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Advanced "Find Story" screen will now find stories that are in the
category the user specifies even if it isn't the story's primary
category. Otherwise it can be impossible to find the story you're looking
for. [Michael Peters]

=back

=head2 3.13 - Apr, 5 2011

=over

=item *

Fixed display issue of time selector in Krang::ElementClass::DateTime
(thanks to Mike Lampson for this patch). [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed bug where you couldn't uncheck the "Show Story Type and Version"
checkbox on the "Find Stories" screen. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug where you couldn't uncheck the "Search full text?" checkbox
on the "Find Templates" screen. [Michael Peters]

=item *

C<hidden> parameters of elements can now be a subroutine reference which
will be executed at runtime and that value used. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed problems with un-localized C<$@> which could make some error
messages not appear in the logs. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed wacky partial error screen when unexpected erorrs happened during
publish from the web UI. [Michael Peters]

=back

=head2 3.12 - Jan, 13 2011

=over

=item *

Added C<--NoStart> option to F<bin/krang_install> when you want to install
but then later tweek things (like F<conf/krang.conf>) before starting the
servers. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added C<--NoDB> option to F<bin/krang_install> for use when you already
have an existing Krang DB and want a new install to use that. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added "hostname dictionary" feature to F<krang.conf> so that you can
specify different values for configuration directives per-hostname.
This allows multiple machines in a Krang cluster to share the same
F<krang.conf> file. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fix bug in F<krang_ctl> that incorrectly used C<sudo> when
starting/stopping the scheduler. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Prevent media files from getting spaces (or other forbidden characters)
in their filenames when bulk-uploaded or added via FTP (already forbidden
in the web UI). [Michael Peters]

=item *

Updated accidental limit where publisher couldn't handle story_ids over
4194304. [Mike Lampson & Michael Peters]

=item *

Don't delete temporary expanded XML files when a KDS import fails so it
can be inspected. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fix problem of starting Apache still being attached to the IO of the starting
terminal making it hang SSH sessions. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fix bug of F<krang_ftpd> where the new FTP daemon wasn't always detaching
itself from the terminal process that started it, thus hanging SSH
sessions when trying to disconnect.

=item *

Fixed bug in IE where people randomly lose their session if they are doing
a lot of publishing and previewing. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Hitting "Save & Stay" on the "Edit Template" screen now doesn't reset the
template editor, so you don't lose your place. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Bulk Upload of Media can now handle resizing images with .jpg and .jpeg
extensions in addition to .png, .gif, and .tiff files.  [Brad Oaks]

=back

=head2 3.11 - August 30, 2010

=over

=item * 

Added C<DBIgnoreVersion> configuration directive to allow for times when
you're upgrading multiple Krang machines at the same time while others
are running. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Pager page numbers and count are now formatted numbers [Michael Peters]

=item *

Status page now uses the C<Charset> directive like the rest of Krang. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Improved performance of ISE notification by running the code under mod_perl
and not CGI. [Michael Peters]

=item * 

Added C<--profile-mode> option to turn on profiling with L<Devel::NYTProf>
from F<bin/krang_apachectl>. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Allow CGI mode to be activated with C<--cgi-mode> option to
F<bin/krang_apachectl>. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Improved navigation rendering performance. [Michael Peters]

=back

=head2 3.10 - June 29, 2010

=over

=item *

Searching for a story now normalizes the url so it can be compared
without problems. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added storage of C<krang_pager_curr_page_num> and
C<krang_pager_show_big_view> to session cache in In
L<Krang::HTMLPager>. The page number is forced to C<1> when switching
between Retired or Live templates, media, and stories. [Brad Oaks]

=item *

Searching for media on the advanced tab will now return media of all
types when no media_type_id is selected. [Brad Oaks]

=item *

Added C<--skip-media> and C<--skip-stories> options to
F<bin/krang_publish>. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug that prevented new categories from being created with the same
URL as an existing story in some circumstances. [Michael Peters]

=item * 

Some autocomplete values were coming back as all lower-case. Case is
now preserved. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Krang scheduler can now be disabled per-instance with the DisableScheduler
directive set to 1. [Brad Oaks]

=item *

Krang will now correctly guess the media type when media files are uploaded
via the FTP interface. [Michael Peters]

=item *

When bulk editing a Story, the C<Done With Bulk Edit> button is now working.  [Brad Oaks]

=item *

Alerts are now able to be sent for actions on any Story or any Media instead of only on specific ones.  [Brad Oaks]

=item *

C<ElementClass::PopupMenu> will now execute subroutine references which are passed to new() for the C<value> key.  [Brad Oaks]

=item *

Importing stories has been greatly improved in the following
ways. [Michael Peters]

=over

=item * Circular dependencies between categories and stories are now handled better

=item * Stories that are changing their class in the import are now handled

=item * When checking for stories who's non-primary url might conflict, we correctly ignore the imported story's other URLs

=back

=back

=head2 3.09 - March 08, 2010

=over

=item *

Adding C<ReservedURLs> configuration directive.  This prevents Krang
users from creating stories or categories with certain URLs.  This is
useful when you have another application serving the Krang published
content and it needs certain URLs reserved for it's functionality.
This can be set per-instance or globally. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed ISE that occurred when certain bad date formats were used
for Cover Dates on stories. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Upgraded L<Apache::Session> and changed our usage to not require
an exclusive lock for every request. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added the F<bin/krang_generate_csv> script. [Michael Peters]

=item *

We now generate higher quality thumbnails and there were a couple of
places (like "Select Media") where thumbnails weren't showing up when
they should have. [Michael Peters]

=item * 

Added new C<command_column_extra_args> option to L<Krang::HTMLPager>
so that more arguments can be passed into the C<command_column_commands>
besides just the id. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added C<read_only> flag to Media and Template objects. This flag
can only be set by the F<bin/krang_read_only> admin script so that these
items can't be set/unset by users. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added C<--category-links> option to F<bin/krang_create_story>
script. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Media Bulk Upload can set a max height and/or max width to scale down
large images. [Brad Oaks]

=item *

Added C<Krang.Form.get_form()> method to make it easier to get the
form in custom Javascript code. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added C<update> (which defaults to C<true>) option to C<Krang.Form.submit()>
to make it easier for addons to create forms which submit and return JSON data. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added ability to search Media by C<Type> (which is C<media_type_id>). [Brad Oaks]

=item *

Fixed ISE that occurs on the Back button when viewing an older version of a template that you have checked out.
It only happened when starting from Workspace and editing a template.  The form action was set to workspace.pl
instead of template.pl in that case.  [Brad Oaks]

=back

=head2 3.08 - December 20, 2009

=over

=item *

Media items now call the element's C<retire_hook>. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added C<may_view_trash> permission. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed ISEs that occurs if you try to check out media or templates
that were checked out by someone else while you were looking at
(normally prevented by the UI). Now you get a helpful alert message
instead. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed ISE on "New Media" screen when submitting the form via "enter"
instead of clicking the "Create" button. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Going from Trash -> View Detail -> View Log -> Back for Media objects
no longer results in an ISE. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Catch more kinds of template errors when previewing a story so they
don't result in an ISE, but a better error message. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added Fedora 12 as a build target. [Michael Peters]

=back

=head2 3.07 - November 5, 2009

=over

=item * 

Fixed various failing tests. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed problem with URL wrapping that prevented copy-pasting of those URLs
from the UI. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Adding C<MinSpareServers>, C<MaxSpareServers>, C<MaxClients> F<krang.conf>
directives that can be used to control how many running Apache processes there
are. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed JS error on Transform Image screen when cancelling and going to
another page. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed IE8 where the Category Chooser on Edit Media screen
was hidden behind every table but the initial one (the meta-data
table). [Michael Peters]

=back

=head2 3.06 - October 18, 2009

=over

=item *

Adding a C<--no-upgrade> option to F<bin/krang_addon_installer> to
make it easier to manage in a cluster. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Unknown publish errors from the Web UI now result in a normal ISE
(die) like other errors and are displayed with the same modal dialog
in the UI. This also triggers the C<ErrorNotificationEmail> to be sent
if configured. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed error when publishing a MediaLink element that didn't actually
have a media object selected. Now we just silently return and continue
with the publish. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Normalize Unicode characters coming in so that we always have single
grapheme characters. Unicode can have "composed" characters where the
same character is actually represented by combining multiple characters.
Use NFC normalization so that we just store a single character. This will
make it easier to do things like full text search on Unicode characters
that might have been submitted as multiple graphemes. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed IE7 where the Category Chooser on Edit Media screen
was hidden behind every table but the initial one (the meta-data
table). [Michael Peters]

=item *

Per user requests, changed default sort order for Find Story 
and Find Media interfaces (toplevel screens and StoryLink/MediaLink 
screens) to descending ID (instead of ascending ID) so newest items 
are visible on the first page. [Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Fixed issue (discovered by Dave Kaufman) where Media and Category Edit 
screens contained duplicate "Done With" & "Delete" buttons when editing
containers, and -- in the case of Category -- the inner "Done With"
was failing. (The above issues appear to have been caused by 
ElementEditor.tmpl being changed without all of the templates that include 
ElementEditor.tmpl being updated.) Also renamed the top-level (big green)
"Delete" buttons on Edit screens "Delete Story", "Delete Media", "Delete 
Category", and "Delete Template" since top-level objects are being
accidentally deleted from within containers by users who are intending
to delete only the container. Finally, added upward arrow to the right 
of innermost "Delete" on Edit screens in order to differentiate THIS 
delete (which operates on the sub-elements above it) from the other two! 
[Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Made ElementEditor's "Find Story" GUI remember (within a session) 
previous selections for search string (simple search), and category, class, 
contrib, cover_date, publish_date, story_id, title and url (advanced
search). [Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Added Fedora 11 as a build platform. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug in Widget module where improperly formatted date strings 
in Date Chooser threw an ISE instead of failing gracefully like 
DateTime Chooser. [Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Media bulk uploads now try to guess the media_type based on the file 
extension. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Now save and display text media object (HTML, CSS, etc) with the same
encoding that we use for other text in the system. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed an ISE if C<BadLoginCount> is set but no username was provided
on the login attempt. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed the deprecated (but retained for backward compatibility) Krang::URL 
module's real_url() method which duplicated the code in, rather than 
simply dispatching to, its recommended successor, the 
Krang::Publisher->url_for() method.  Now url_for() can be overridden or 
extended in an addon subclass and any exisitng code still using the old 
pkg('URL')->real_url() calls will be enhanced too. [David Kaufman]

=item *

Prevent double clicks (which cause duplicate requests to the server, hidden
ISEs and session locking) by making sure that the same Ajax request doesn't
happen within 2 seconds of the last time it was requested. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::ElementClass's flattened-template code (introduced in v3.04) 
that was failing to distinguish the empty-string from an undefined value when 
recursively populating a template's inner loops. [Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Upgraded source modules that were throwing ISEs when trying to use
the Changeable Elements feature introduced in Krang v3.05. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug in Story::find() that caused very slow double-join on story-category 
table. NOTE: Fix entails slight permissioning change: in the past, a user 
with may_see permissions in Category A but without them in Category B would 
only be shown stories whose PRIMARY category was A, not those whose primary 
category was B and whose SECONDARY category was A. This will no longer be
the case (which is hopefully an improvement). [Noam Weinstein]

=item * 

Upgraded DBI from 1.58 to 1.609 and DBD::mysql from 4.005 to 4.012,
(both had gotten about 2 years old) [David Kaufman]

=item * 

Updated Debian Platform README file to document how to install the 
O/S prerequisites needed to build krang on Debian 5 (Lenny).
[David Kaufman]

=item * 

Upgraded Pod::Simple from 2.0.5 to 3.08, and added podlators 2.2.2
which provides an update for Pod::Man to resolve build problems in
Module::Build on perl 5.10; Krang now builds on Debian 5 (Lenny)
[David Kaufman]

=item *

Upgraded Storable from 2.1.3 to 2.2.0 to resolve build problems on 
perl 5.10 on Debian 5 (Lenny) [David Kaufman]

=item *

Upgraded Image::Size from 3.1.1 to 3.2 and its prerequisite 
Compress::Zlib from 1.31 to 2.20 (Compress::* packages are now 
split into IO-Compress-2.020, Compress-Raw-Zlib and 
Compress-Raw-Bzip2) [David Kaufman]

=item *

Fixed Bug #42 "Scheduler errors from _expire_sessions()" in which 
the logs were polluted with exceptions every five minutes while there 
are no sessons to expire [David Kaufman]

=item *

Made UTF-8 the default character set and updated POD accordingly. 
[Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Fixed three warnings thrown by krang_install when installing from a
binary tarball distribution: two errors reported to the user when the 
regex used to find & fix the path to perl in shebang lines of perl 
scripts failed to match the two perl xinha plugin scripts (because 
they include seldem-used but valid whitespace between the #! and the 
interpreter command line), and 2) a "can't stat krang/bench: No such 
file or directory" warning caused by the krang/bench directory not 
being present in plaform-specific binary distributions. [David Kaufman]

=item *

Added to PoorText JavaScript workaround for Gecko bugs
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=438840 and
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=436703. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed bug in ElementEditor CGI where any container that included both
a hidden element and reorderable elements threw an ISE.
[Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Fixed bug in ElementEditor/edit.base.tmpl which caused Done button
to be missing from any container element not set to allow_delete => 1.
[Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Fixed bug in BrowserSpeedBoost that did not clear out old compressed HTML
files or regenerate new minified/compressed assets if the underlying file
changed. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Various fixes to PoorText to make it play nicely with IE8. [Bodo
Schulze]

=item *

Upgraded Prototype.js to version 1.6.1_rc2 to fix issues with
IE8. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed utf8 bug in Krang template generation and filtering. [Bodo
Schulze]

=item *

Added "Preview Editor" instrumenting previewed stories with links
pointing back into the CMS. Also integrates the previously added
"Template Finder". [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed ISE that occurs if you try to check out a story that was checked out by someone
else while you were looking at (normally prevented by the UI). Now you get a helpful
alert message instead. [Michael Peters]

=back

=head2 3.05 - March 15, 2009

=over

=item *

Fixed bug in L<Krang::BulkEdit::Xinha> where empty tags were not
handled correctly (thanks to Mike Lampson for catching this). Added
method returning a list of supported empty HTML tags. This list
currently contains only HR. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Add F<bin/krang_tmp_cleaner> to clean out the F<tmp/> directory while
developing. [Michael Peters]

=item  *

Added F<bin/krang_create_story> for making test data while
developing. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added Fedora 10 as a target build platform. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed a bug preventing to add a photo to a new contributor when coming
from associate contrib. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added thumbnail preview to L<Krang::ElementClass::MediaLink> and
contrib edit screen. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Replaced JavaScript links in story and media preview links with DOM2
event handlers everywhere. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added "Preview Finder" feature. After clicking the "Preview Finder"
button on story preview screens, clicking anywhere on the page
provides information on the template (and its parents) or the media
text file (for SSI) responsible for generating the piece of content
that was clicked. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added JavaScript library ProtoPopup in F<htdocs/proto_popup/>
providing draggable info boxes as well as alert-like and confirm-like
dialogs. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

L<Krang::AddOn>: When installing an addon, install the upgrade/
subdir, too - to self-document the upgrade. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Reorganized Admin menu into subsections. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added IE6 behavior rules section in F<krang.js> and put the hover
handler for the great green buttons in there. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added C<version> option to L<Krang::Media>'s file_path() method. [Bodo
Schulze]

=item *

Added a --url option to F<krang_upload_templates> to limit the upload
to templates having the specified URL below path (may be given
multiple times). [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added C<--no-cache> option to F<krang_publish> to bypass using
L<Krang::Cache>. [Michael Peters]

=item * 

Added the ability to use the "Find Media" interface for selecting the
image for a contributor instead of having to upload a new image each
time. [Michael Peters]

=item *

When publishing from the command line using F<krang_publish> and
C<--to-preview> a single error in publishing 1 story won't cause the
whole process to stop. It will continue on and then list failures at the
end just like publishing without C<--to-preview> does. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added optional C<level>, C<dir_only> and C<depth_only> arguments to
method signature of L<Krang::Story>::category(). [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added new element class L<Krang::ElementClass::PoorTextList> which
joins the WYSIWYG capabilities of L<Krang::ElementClass::PoorText>
with the list management controls of
L<Krang::ElementClass::TextInputList>. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added 'binary' argument to $publisher->additional_content_block(),
hence to Krang::IO->io_file(), to make it possible to write images
(and other binary data). [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed minor but disconcerting bug where reverting a template to an
earlier version also reverted its "Deployed Version". [Noam Weinstein]

=item *

At the request of Jesse Erlbaum, added a Size selector to
Default::image. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed bug in F<krang.js> C<Krang.Form.submit()> where if the C<new_window>
option was true we'd pass the existing window_id to it, in essence having
2 windows with the same window_id which could cause some strange things
to happen (multiple windows with the same session). [Michael Peters]

=item *

Allowed L<Krang::Story>::delete() to be called with the named
parameters 'story_id' (a number) or 'class' (a string or an arrayref
of class names). [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added directive B<PreInstallScript> to F<krang_addon.conf> to run a
script before the installation process starts. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added new element class L<Krang::ElementClass::TextInputList>. Added
it to L<Krang::ElementLibrary>'s autoload list, added three examples
to L<TestSet1::page> and its template, and added some CSS to
F<krang.css.tmpl>. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Like Stories, find Media and Templates in Live, Retired and Trash when
finding by ID or UUID. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Enhanced L<Krang::Publisher>'s additional_content_block() to accept an
optional hashref of category_tmpl_args to pass to L<Krang::Category>'s
fill_template method. [Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Made L<Krang::Element>'s children() method accept one argument to
return a list of children having the given name only, and added
convenience method children_data(). [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed bug to let the a template's Log be viewed from its "View Detail"
screen. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::Handler> reported by Alice Lincoln: Make sure
a manually created window gets its own id when the user types/copies a
Krang URL into it or accesses another windows URL via the History.
Thanx to Jesse Erlbaum for the referer-based solution to this problem.
Also implemented a workaround in krang.js to force IE6/7 to send the
referer when a link is passed through JavaScript. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added a server-side paste filter to L<Krang::ElementClass::PoorText>,
triggered by the onPaste event. [Bodo Schulze]


=item *

Added linked_stories() to L<Krang::ElementClass> to make this interface
available to all element classes, especially WYSIWYG editors and the
like. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Made sure a media is reported as unpublished after changing its
category. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added convenience method C<root_category()> to
L<Krang::Category>. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Integrated PoorText with StoryLink interface. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added the C<ErrorNotificationEmail> configuration directive that can contain an optional
comma-separated list of email address that will be sent an email with details about
any Internal Server Errors that occur. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added C<retire_hook> and C<unretire_hook> hooks for element classes when things are moved

out of the trash. [Michael Peters]

Added the ability to change an element's class in the Element Editor
UI if the element library is configured to allow it (using the
C<ChangeableElementClasses> directive in F<set.conf>). [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added a new WYSIWYG element class L<Krang::ElementClass::PoorText> and all
it takes. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed bug where user could Edit a story, then View an old version of it,
then click Edit from the View screen, in effect wiping out anything
that had been left unsaved in their session. [Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Fixed bug where it was possible from the View Schedule screen to 'View' the

Fixed Safari errors in Xinha-based bulk-editing

and log entries). [Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Fix to unpreview a media object when it is deleted (instead of just 
unpublishing it). [David Kaufman]

=item *

Refactored bulk edit in its own classes.  The legacy textarea-based
bulk editing is in L<Krang::BulkEdit::Textarea>.  Xinha-based bulk
editing is provided by L<Krang::BulkEdit::Xinha>. This module largely
uses parsing instead of regexes to sanitize/scrub the HTML coming from
Xinha. Xinha's toolbar and the set of allowed block-level tags are
configurable via subclassing L<Krang::BulkEdit::Xinha::Config>.  This
module also permits configuration of whether paragraphs should be split 
on BR tags. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Pass the browser engine name to the environment via
KRANG_BROWSER_ENGINE. This enables clients to dispatch to
Krang::Markup::SomeBrowserEngine methods. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added modules to filter incoming/outgoing HTML markup according to
what different browser engines' markup commands can handle in WYSIWYG
areas.  The base class L<Krang::Markup> is subclassed by
L<Krang::Markup::Gecko>, L<Krang::Markup::IE> and
L<Krang::Markup::WebKit>. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Upgraded L<HTML::Parser> to version 3.56. [Bodo Schulze]

=item * 

Removed Image-Info-1.15.tar.gz from src/ and replaced it with
Image-Size-3.1.1.tar.gz to fix bugs in L<Krang::Media>'s width() and
height() methods in which, for certain valid JPEG images, these
methods returned undef (and for others, returned an arrayref!)
According to its own POD docs, L<Image::Info> is "deprecated, and
should not be used", "has numerous bugs", is only minimally
maintained, and recommends the use of L<Image::Size> to replace these
functions.  Krang now appears to return correct width and height
values for all JPEG's tested. [David Kaufman]

=item * 

Separated the two perl classes in lib/Krang/FTP/FileHandle.pm into
their own files so that either can be more easily subclassed in an
addon, without having to override all the code in both unnecessarily
[David Kaufman]

Corresponding to the behavior of L<Krang::Story>'s delete(), made Made
L<Krang::Media>'s delete() and L<Krang::Template>'s delete() throw a

Fixed bug in krang_upload_templates and krang_rename_categories that
sets NO_ELEMENTLIBS to 1 even though it's necessary to instantiate the
Category element when creating new categories. [Noam Weinstein]

Added DateTime and Time elements similar to those used for cover_date
input. [David Kaufman]

=item *

Replaced package constants, global and lexical variables in

Standardized locations of bottom-panel buttons on Edit screens. 
[Noam Weinstein]

=item *

Fixed bug where cloning a read-only story doesn't reset may_edit flag.  
[Noam Weinstein]

Added 'force-checkin' option to krang_upload_templates and
krang_upload_media.  (In the past objects checked out to other users

Added 'View Log' to Media View (r4815) and Template View (r4820)
screens. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

For Media Edit screen, ripped out 'Publish to Preview' button
including its JavaScript function and Perl runmode, since each Save

introduced by Noam in r4513). [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Replaced C<src/Digest-MD5-2.23.tar.gz> with
C<src/Digest-MD5-2.36_patched_for_UTF8.tar.gz> which handles UTF-8
data transparently. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Made sure each Krang template points to its own help files.  Also
streamlined help file names to ease the making of more sophisticated
help systems. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added C<t/dict/words.ascii> (to generate filenames and the like) and
C<t/dict/words.latin1>, a mixture of English, French, German, Italian,
Portuguese and Spanish words for content generation.  Also made all
tests use L<Krang::Test::Content>'s get_word() method to generate UTF-8
content if the Charset directive says so.

=item *

Added localization admin scripts C<lang/bin/krang_lang_installer>,
C<lang/bin/krang_lang_uninstaller> and

Fix bug that occurs when changing a user's info the user would then
be forced to change their password the next time they logged in if
C<PasswordChangeTime> were set. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fix ISE that happens when creating a new user via the UI when 
C<PasswordChangeCount> is set to a non-zero value. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed a bug where C<< Krang::Story->revert() >> would set the
C<checked_out> field to the C<checked_out_by> column, thus breaking
the "Active Stories" screen. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Story Type selector on Find Story Advanced Search is now ordered
by the element's C<display_name>. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Added C<use_data>, C<use_data_size> and C<cache_key> options to
L<Krang::HTMLPager>'s C<new()>. Also added C<calculate_limit()>,
C<calculate_order_by()>, C<calculate_order_desc()> 
and C<calculate_current_page_num()> to expose the inner calculations
when needed. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed element editor to not display a delete button when no elements
allow deletion.  Also suppressed the Order checkbox when nothing is
reorderable. [Sam]

=item * 

Send no-cache HTTP headers for all L<Krang::CGI> requests. This
will fix some problems when logging in as a different user with
the same browser session in IE. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Upgraded to HTML::Template v2.9 fixing several bugs. [Sam]

=item *

Added a new configuration variable, PreviewSSL, which controls whether
links to preview use SSL.  This behavior was previously the default
when EnableSSL was set, but now it is available independently and can
be turned off even when Krang itself is using SSL.  [Sam]

=item * 

During DB creation, addon F<sql/> files should come after core
Krang. This allows addons to change existing Krang data/tables. 
[Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug where deleting a category which was used in an advanced
searched caused an ISE when returning to the advanced search.  [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where use of URL search on Find Template would result in
incorrect substitution of % for non-alphanumeric characters. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where hitting enter on the new or edit template screens
would produce an ISE.  [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug in media find - searches which included _ or % wouldn't find
anything. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed media bulk upload to ignore MacOSX fluff in upload archives
(__MACOSX directory, .DS_Store, .localized). [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug in New Template where it was impossible to clear the category
selector after making a selection and clicking Save.  [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in media bulk upload - unless the media object was
originally created with its filename for title (i.e. uploaded via
bulk-upload or FTP) then trying to replace it with bulk upload
wouldn't work. [Sam]

=item *

In Krang::CGI::Status, import only ':html' functions from CGI, since
CGI's param() may mess up CAP's param().  [Bodo Schulze]


=item *

Added two new methods to Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel,
publish_frontend_app_template() and publish_frontend_app_stub().
These new methods permit a Krang site to publish interactive 
applications and templates for those applications easily and
consistently.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Modified Site Server configuration to support CGI applications
(ending in ".cgi") and Apache::Registry apps (ending ".pl").
This will permit the site server to host interactive applications.
[Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Added new parameter "mode" to additional_content_block() method
in Publisher.  This new parameter permits the permission of the
file to be set, which is particularly useful for publishing
executable files.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item * 

Changed SiteServer to forbid any request which doesn't match a
publish or preview URL.  SiteServer trans handler now sets up 
C< $ENV{DOCUMENT_ROOT} > correctly which is needed in a CGI environment.
[Jesse Erlbaum]


=item * 

Krang::lib set to also ignore ".svn" directories.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Stricter enforcement of asset permissions. [Michael Peters]

=item *

During Apache and FTP startup, krang now properly calls AddOn
init-handlers. [Michael Peters]

=back



=head2 2.008 - Dec 20th, 2006

=over

=item *

Fixed a long standing publishing bug.  Shuffling stories around could
cause the wrong files to be deleted when publishing.  [Sam]

=item *

Added several new configuration options which allow Krang instances to
run on separate IPs and have different SSL configurations.  [Sam]

=item *

Added a new option for addons, DataSetClasses.  This allows addons to
extend Krang::DataSet and include new objects in KDS files.  [Sam]

=item *

Implemented a system of universally-unique identifiers (UUIDs) for Krang
objects with keys that may change (ex. stories may change their URL).
This allows updates between machines to propagate these changes
correctly when objects are moved with krang_export and krang_import.
[Sam]

=item *

Added C<PasswordChangeTime> and C<PasswordChangeCount> directives
to allow the forcing of users to change their password every C<PasswordChangeTime>
days and not permit users to use old passwords with C<PasswordChangeCount>
changes. [Michael Peters]

=item *

More uniform password validation. Now also easier to implement a custom
password policy as an addon. [Michael Peters]

=item * 

Added security feature of locking out users after several failed login
attempts. Configurable by the C<BadLoginCount>, C<BadLoginWait> and
C<BadLoginNotify> conf directives. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::AddOn which would cause multiple version upgrades
which include changes to class.conf to fail.  Specifically, the updated
class.conf (and other libraries) were not being reloaded until after
the upgrade ran.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Fixed bug in import where templates that were not deployed on the original
site, where deployed on the target site upon import. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug in install/upgrade when using a binary built for SSL
in the way SSL symlinked conf files were handled. [Michael Peters]

=back

=head2 2.007 - Sep 14th, 2006

=over

=item *

Changed ElementClass::ListGroup input_form so that it will not
redundantly label single-dimensional lists.  Also modified 
ListGroup to be more easily sub-classed. [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Fixed bug in which HTTP redirects in KRANG_DEBUG mode would
cause session to not be unloaded and saved to disk.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

MSIE Mac is not un-supported (it never was really, it's now
official). Allow Konqueror to come in as well. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed several places lacking in HTML escaping, particularly
in places that used Krang::HTMLPager. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Krang now automatically deletes any alerts tied to a desk when
that desk is deleted. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed krang_install --FromBackup issues when the backups contain
addons. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug where KDS import would trigger delete_hook calls when
updating elements for stories and categories. [Sam]

=item *

Allow users whose page-size preference is 100, to be able to toggle
between 100 and 20, instead of 100 and 100. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed redirect problem when going to the installation root already
logged in on a single installation machine (resulted in a 404).
[Michael Peters]

=item *

Entering F<publisher.pl> without any query params or a story in
the session will now redirect to the workspace instead of croak'ing.
[Michael Peters]

=item *

Fix issue in Krang::CGI::Story::db_save() changes to the slug or title
could get lost if the submission was invalid for other reasons.
[Michael Peters]

=item *

In Krang::CGI::Story::view(), use tmpl_var 'is_root' to inform
templates/Story/view.tmpl whether to show the 'Edit' button or not.
In templates/Story/view.tmpl, get rid of tmpl_var 'old_version'
which fails to show this button when returning from viewing a non-root
sub-element.  [Bodo Schulze]


=item *

In templates/Contrib/associate_list_view.tmpl, alert user if no
contributor has been checked to (un-)associate.  [Bodo Schulze]


=item *

SiteServer configuration now does server-side includes by default.
SSI is very common for sites managed by Krang.  This will make
development use of the SiteServer more useful and easier.
[Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Binary distributions now include src/ allowing for rebuilding
installed copies of Krang. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed several bin/ scripts to always load Krang::Conf via
Krang::ClassLoader before using it.  This fixes problems overriding
Krang::Conf in an addon.  [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel error message.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Fixed long-standing bug in Krang::ElementClass::ListGroup in which 
multi-dimensional sub lists would not update if you used the
keyboard (not the mouse) to update the selected item.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Added --delete_missing and --input_file options to krang_create_lists.
The latter will permit you to specify a lists.conf file for import.
The former will delete list/group/items which are not found in the
specified lists.conf (as opposed to adding the new records to the 
existing ones).  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=back


=head2 2.006 - August 11th, 2007

=over

=item *

Fixed bulk-edit to allow white-space on the blank line separating
paragraphs.  [Sam]

=item *

Modified krang_schedulectl to skip scheduler start-up if 
SchedulerMaxChildren parameter is set to 0 in krang.conf.
This is useful in development when you do not want the
scheduler to run.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item * 

Added new --grep option to krang_upload_media.  This option
permits you to use a regex to filter what you want media
to upload.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Changed krang_upload_templates script to now handle "global"
templates (those without categories).  Fixed undefined value
warning in Krang::Template when searching for templates
without categories.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Upgraded Archive::Tar to latest version (v1.29) to correct several
annoying bugs, including the nefarious "unable to read chunk" bug
related to high-ASCII characters contained in archived files.
[Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Added --clean option to bin/krang_addon_installer. [Michael Peters]


=item *

Added new index to element table.  This index will greatly speed 
complex publishing logic.  Thanks to James Reidy for identifying
the bottleneck.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Fixed a bug in benchmarking system.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Fixed a bug which could cause an upgrade to fail if the target Krang
has media files with single-quotes in their filenames. [Sam]

=back

=head2 2.005 - June 1st, 2006

=over

=item *

Made changes to Krang's Javascript to allow easier future integration
of Prototype Javascript library. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug in Default::fancy_keywords; updates to fields would be lost
if a new element was added to the story. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Upgraded to HTML::Template::Expr v0.07, providing a better expression
syntax and some bug-fixes. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed a bug which occurred when a story was reverted after a change in
category assignment. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed KDS deserialization to work when categories point to stories and
media below in the category tree. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::CGI::Site::add_save_stay() where clicking "Delete"
right after "Save & Stay" wouldn't delete the newly created
site. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added missing button GIF for Xinha's SuperClean plugin. [Bodo Schulze]

=item * 

Fixed krang_upgrade and krang_build to prevent overwriting existing
SSL certificates [Michael Peters]

=item *

Upgraded HTML::PopupTreeSelect to v1.5, fixing a bug affecting Firefox
and Camino on Mac OSX. [Sam]

=back

=head2 2.004

=over

=item *

Adapted t/publish.t to Michael Peters' SSL simplification patch. [Bodo
Schulze]

=item *

Fixed addon v2 compat bug in t/find.t. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Fixed Xinha link-munging so that you can now use the WYSIWYG editor
to create links and images.  Full-screen mode now works properly.
[Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

In Krang::Publish I decoupled processing of assets from publish_story()
and preview_story() allowing for future subclassing into Krang::Publisher::Parallel
simply redefine _process_assets() and _process_preview_assets().
[Aaron Dancygier]

=item *

In Krang::Test::Content, modified _init_words() to skip words
containing an apostrophe. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added a new configuration parameter, Charset.  This may be used to
control the character set for the Krang user-interface.  [Sam]

=item *

Fixed "Forbidden" bug in Xinha implementation by permitting 
static Xinha files.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Made Krang::CGI::Category::find() and find_row_handler() addon v2
compliant. [Bodo Schulze]

=item * 

Added enforcement of permissions at the application and run-mode level
rather than just at the UI level. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Make admin list manager work intuitively and statefully.  Pressing
RETURN does no longer submit the form, but adds a new to the
list. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

In element_lib/TestParent1/* and element_lib/TestSet1/*, added addon
v2 compatibility. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

In t/cgi.t, fixed addon v2 compat bug. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Upgraded to HTML::Template::Expr v0.06 - now with chained binary
operators! [Sam]

=item *

In Krang::Story, fixed addon v2 compatibility bug in find(). [Bodo
Schulze]

=item *

In Krang::History, replaced constants FIELDS, OBJECT_TYPES AND ACTIONS
with methods fields(), object_types() and actions()
respectively. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Allow multiple word action names in admin scheduler. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

In admin contrib list view, made type column sortable. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

For Krang::History, allow Krang::Story, Krang::Media and
Krang::Template to be overlayed with addon modules. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added documentation for Krang::Widget::template_chooser() and cleaned
up template_chooser code. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added tests for scalar methods admin_categories_ftp and admin_lists to
t/group.t [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Added new primitive, Krang::ElementClass::CheckBoxGroup, 
which integrates with Krang's lists system, in addition
to permitting simple values.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Added new option "--makecats" to krang_upload_media and 
krang_upload_templates.  When specified, missing categories
will be created in the CMS, instead of skipped.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::ElementClass::ListGroup and Krang::ElementClass::RadioGroup 
such that associated ListItems will now be automatically added to the 
DataSet.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::ElementClass::Date where date would change if KDS
was exported from a machine in one time zone and imported on a machine
in an earlier time zone.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=back


=head2 v2.003

=over

=item *

Fixed sql/mypref.sql so that user's don't clobber each others
preferences. [Bodo Schulze]

Added missing setting of template param 'parent_path' to
Krang::CGI::ElementEditor::find_story_link() [Bodo Schulze]

from the UI.
[Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed ISE when viewing media files from the Scheduler UI.
[Michael Peters]

=back


=head2 v2.002

=over


=item *

Added new script krang_upload_media.  This works similarly to krang_upload_templates.
Using this script you can maintain a media/ directory in your add-on 
which contains all site-specific media.  This is particularly useful for
development, when developing templates and site design.  The script
krang_createdb now automatically loads any media found in your
add-on directory.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Fixed L<Krang::Group> test to not key explicitly on name to simplify
overriding. [Peter Leonard]

=item *

Added addon admin scheduler 'admin_scheduler' permissioning bit so only admin users 
will see this feature. [Aaron Dancygier]

=item *

bin/krang_upgrade now checks that ENV{KRANG_ROOT} is unset [Aaron Dancygier]

=item *

Fixed bug in bin/krang_upgrade and bin/krang_createdb where without quotes mysql 
was converting db_version to float, instead of as just a string. [Aaron Dancygier]

=item *

Removed previous patch (v1.22) to bin/krang_upgrade.  Patch checked an upgrade 
directory in each addon directory for upgrade scripts to run. This is already 
supported in bin/krang_addon_installer.  In effect every time you upgraded krang 
it would re-apply addon upgrade scripts. [Aaron Dancygier]

=back


=head2 v2.001

=over

=item *

Installer now chowns krang.conf to KrangUser:KrangGroup
instead of to root. [David Kaufman]

=item *

L<Krang::XML::Validator> now looks in the C<schema/> directories of
installed Krang addons to find .xsd files describing objects to be
imported or exported.  This furthers the support for non-standard
objects within Krang. [Peter Leonard]

=item *

Upgraded to HTML::Template v2.8 and HTML::Template::Expr v0.05. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed Krang::CGI::Help to lookup help files in an addon's
F<htdocs/help/> directory, allowing addons to provide their own help
content. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a flaw in Krang::Handler that allowed access to any file via the
root handler.  Now only image files and the two Krang CSS files are
accessible without logging-in. [Sam]

=item *

Added new script, krang_upload_templates, to upload a 
directory of templates into a Krang instance.  Modified
krang_createdb to call this script.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Sweetened up Krang::ElementClass::RadioGroup to use HTML
<labels>, and to allow you to specify a number of columns
for the input form.  Added "list_group" parameter to allow
RadioGroup to be populated from a Krang list.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Added "find" parameter to Krang::ElementClass::StoryLink and 
::MediaLink, to allow element authors to pre-set a filter
in their element library.  Cleaned up some tests, silenced
some spurious warnings.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::Alert which would not allow sub-classes of Krang
objects to be used.  Fixed Krang::ListItem tests in t/find.t, and
improved order_desc test to check entire result set.  Fixed bug
in t/library.t which caused some tests to appear without names.
[Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Fixed a bug in krang_create_lists which caused script to fail for
new addon system.  Added new feature to krang_create_lists and
lists.conf to permit list items to be specified. [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Fixed a bug in which some tests would fail if the configured 
element set did not have an "article" type.  Tests will now run
even if you're using a custom element library.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::lib which caused "legacy" /krang/element_lib path to
not be included in Perl's @INC path.  [Jesse Erlbaum]


=item *

Extended bin/krang_upgrade to check an upgrade directory in each addon directory for  
upgrade scripts to run.  This is in addition to $KRANG_ROOT/upgrade. [Mike Friedman]


=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::ListItem that did not allow sub-classes of
Krang::List and Krang::ListItem to be used. [Bodo Schulze]


=item *

Made URL in message 'story_publish' a link opening the published 
story in a new window. [Bodo Schulze]


=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::Story which would not allow subclasses of
Krang::Contrib, Krang::ElementClass::StoryLink and
Krang::ElementClass::MediaLink to be used. [Bodo Schulze]

=item *

Addon-v2 compliance for bin scripts 
krang_scheduled krang_schedulectl krang_load_skin krang_info krang_ftpd
krang_ftpctl krang_floodfill krang_delete krang_create_lists krang_category_rename
krang_bench krang_backup krang_apachectl krang_siteserverctl krang_makedist krang_publish

Fixed a bug in bin/krang_backup where foreign key constraints in the wrong order were 
conflicting with addons containing innodb tables.  Patch sets foreign_key_checks=0 
at the top of the dump file. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::Publisher::ZeroSizeOutPut().  Wrong hash keys specified.
[Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Added C<delete> action to track in Krang::History::add_history().

Converted default element set to use Krang::ClassLoader and Krang::ClassFactory in 
compliance with new addon system. [Aaron Dancygier]

Added support for Fedora Core 4. [Aaron Dancygier]

=item *

Fixed compile bug in krang_backup introduced during the addon v2
work. [Sam]

Fixed link to static files (images, CSS, Javascript) to work through
the root server. [Sam]

=back

=head2 v1.999

=over

=item *

Added support for a new optional DBSock directive in krang.conf that
allows Krang to connect to a local MySQL server using a
user-configurable socket file location to resolve socket-related DBI
connection errors. [David Kaufman]

=item *

Refactored Krang::Scheduler class into 
Krang::Schedule 
Krang::Schedule::Action and 
Krang::Schedule::Action::[expire|publish|...|YourClass]
Where YourClass must implement an execute method.  
This Paves the way for custom scheduler addons.  
Simply write a class that inherits from Krang::Schedule::Action and
implements an execute() method. [Aaron Dancygier]

=item *

Added conditional Scheduler link in left nav bar under admin section 
This is for non story or media related administrative scheduler addons.
Link points to new admin scheduler screen.
Allows you to use scheduler addons in place of external scripts run

Fixed bug in Krang::ElementClass::ListGroup::validate() which prevented
lists from setting required=>1.  [Jesse Erlbaum]

=item *

Fix bug that prevents users with "may check in all" permission from 
checking in templates checked out by other users. [Perrin]

=item * Add-On v2

The add-on v2 project is complete, bringing many improvements to the
way Krang add-ons work.  Here's a list of the biggest changes:

=over

=item * Add-ons are now located installed into a separate direction
called C<addons/>.  They may be developed in-place, potentially under
separate version control.

=item * Add-ons may be packaged with dependencies from CPAN in a
C<src/> directory.  The Krang build system will build these modules at
install time.

=item * Add-ons may be uninstalled using the new
C<krang_addon_uninstaller> script.  (This does not apply to addons
installed with the old system.)

=item * Add-ons may register new links in the left-navigation area.

=item * Add-ons may selectively override core Krang classes via
inheritance and the use of the C<conf/class.conf> configuration file.

=item * Add-ons may include SQL source for new tables which will be
included in the databases built by C<krang_createdb>.

=back

=item * WYSIWYG HTML Editor

Added a new element class, Krang::ElementClass::XinhaEditor, which
offers a WYSIWYG HTML editor based on the Xinha Javascript editor.
[Sam]

=item * Build Optimization

The Krang build system no longer builds man-pages for all the modules
it builds.  This reduces the overall build time by about 10%.  [Sam] 

=item * Upgraded to Apache v1.3.33.  

This brings Krang up-to-date with all released Apache security
fixes. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where setting use_category_templates to 0 in your
top-level class meant no additional_content_blocks will get category
content, regardless of their individual use_category setting. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where if you set publish_category_per_page to 1 in your
top-level class then any additional_content_blocks with use_category
set to 1 would get the last page's category content. [Sam]

=item *

Added a new method to Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel, file_mode().
This method may be overridden to control the mode of published
files. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where a category linking to a sub-category via an element
would break krang_import. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed the Krang FTP server to return template sorted by filename. [Sam]

=item *

Added support for Module::Build to the Krang build system. [Sam]

=item *

Documentation formatting cleanup. [Don Brodale]

=item *

Fixed a bug where the publish_category_per_page setting wasn't being
respected for additional content blocks. [Sam]

=back



=head2 v1.1025 - May 20, 2005

=over

=item *

Added ability for categories to be created or removed via the FTP
interface.  Added new group permission, "Manage categories via FTP"
which defaults to OFF.  Turn this on to permit your users to use
this new feature.  Fixed ASCII-mode bug in FTP interface. [Daniel Packer]


=item *

Added new platform files for RedHat Enterprise Server 
ES3 and ES4. [Jesse Erlbaum]

=back

=head2 v1.102 - April 18th 2004

=over

=item *

Added a new Krang::ElementClass method, mark_form_invalid().  This
method may be overridden to alter how Krang marks element form fields
invalid.  The default behavior, wrapping the field in a span set to the
"invalid" class remains. [Sam]

=item *

Upgraded to the latest release of HTML::PopupTreeSelect, v1.5. [Sam]

=item *

Improved support for Mac OSX, both in compilation and
documentation. [Aaron Ross]

=item *

Fixed amusing bug in Krang::Test::Content that was causing the same random
word sequences to be generated multiple times when called in a tight loop.
[Perrin]

=item *

Fixes to the import process as it affects L<Krang::ListItem>
objects - list orders are now preserved properly.  [Peter]

=item *

Can now bundle L<Krang::List> data with your element library, and have
it imported when the database is created (in the same fashion as
C<templates.kds>).  The file is C<lists.kds>.  [Peter]

=item *

Added C<slug> as a variable available to all templates at
publish-time.  This was intended to be there all along, but somehow
fell through the cracks.  [Peter]

=item *

L<Krang::ElementClass::ListGroup> now handles multidimensional lists
of arbitrary depth.  Further testing is needed, but so far things look
good.  [Peter Leonard, Andrea Bonotto]

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::DataSet> with loading compressed C<.kds.gz> files
and added a test for it.  Also fixed bug in dataset.t where it was not
skipping all the tests that need TestSet1 when TestSet1 is not available
[Perrin]

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::List> - default sort order for C<find> was by
C<name>, it is now by C<parent_list_id>.  [Peter]

=item *

Added tutorial documentation on how to use Lists in an element library. [Peter]

=item *

Changed HTML in templates to use C<text> rather than C<textfield> in form 
inputs. [Perrin]

=item *

Updated several modules: DBI to 1.47, WWW-Mechanize to 1.10,
URI to 1.35, and libwww-perl to 5.803. [Perrin]

=item *

Added C<bin/krang_addon_framework> - a new script to create a
supporting framework to simplify development of Krang addons. [Peter]

=item *

Added C<--rebuild> option to C<bin/krang_build> allowing it to build modules
even if there is an existing Krang build already. [Perrin]

=back

=head2 v1.101 - January 20, 2005

=over

=item *

Added C<--not_on_desk> option to C<bin/krang_publish> - limiting
publishing to checked-in items that are not on any desk. [Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::Schedule> - cleanup of the C<tmp/> directory
was not being done properly.  This is now fixed. [Peter]

=item *

Cleaned up how C<KRANG_PERSIST> variables are stored in the session
cache for remembering search preferences.  The cleanup also fixed a
number of bugs - the C<Clear> buttons on the advanced-search pages now
work again, category searches are now done on a per-type basis
(e.g. separate Story/Media/Template category-search prefs), and search
terms are remembered properly. [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::CGI::ElementEditor> - the new "save always
reorders" functionality that is part of 1.100 was breaking bulk-edit,
where reordering never happens.  This now works properly.  [Peter]


=item *

Added error-handling for Stories that return a zero-length string when
previewed/published.  [Peter]


=item *

Upgraded L<Imager> to 0.44 from 0.43, which fixes a bug involving
thumbnailing of extreme-aspect-ratio images. [Peter]

=item *

Fixed error message trapping in C<bin/krang_install> to get Krang to
play nicer with MySQL 4.1.x [Peter]

=item *

C<bin/krang_install> and C<bin/krang_createdb> now handle the C<@localhost>
in the MySQL user creation consistently. [Perrin]

=item *

C<bin/krang_ctl> no longer uses sudo for starting things on unprivileged
ports. [Perrin]

=item *

Upgraded C<Scalar-List-Utils> to 1.14 from 1.09 - this should fix some
compilation issues with MacOSX. [Peter]

=back

=head2 v1.100 - January 4, 2005

=over

=item *

C<About Krang> now reports server IP address, AddOns are now
alphabetized properly. [Peter]

=item *

Added server IP address, along with instance-by-instance breakdowns to
C<bin/krang_info> [Peter].

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::Story>->_load_version() - the restored version
of the story still held outdated checkout and publish settings.  The
restored version now returns default values for those parameters
(e.g. not checked out, not published).  Note that this does not affect
C<revert()>.  The result is that scheduled publication of specific
story versions now works.  [Peter]

=item *

Added C<build_preview_url> to L<Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel>. [Peter]

=item *

Added alt_tag and alt_tag_like searching to L<Krang::Media>, also added
as an option in Media advanced find screen. [Matt]

=item * 

Clicking Story save/save and stay now reorders elements as well. [Matt]

=item *

L<Krang::Story>->find() can now search over a list of site_ids.
[Peter]

=item *

Bugfix to L<Krang::Category>->deserialize_xml().  Circular
dependencies were not being handled properly, causing imports of some
.kds files to fail. [Peter]

=item *

Upgraded DBD-mysql to 2.9004.  [Peter]

=item *

Bugfix to L<Krang::Dataset> - now xml files are validated based on
their appearance in the index.xml file, as opposed to using File::Find
in the xml dir. [Matt]

=item *

Added session caching of search/advanced search options for 
Story/Media/Template. [Matt]

=item *

Added L<Krang::Publisher>->publish_context() - a means of storing
arguments during the publish of a given story. [Peter]

=item *

Added storage of sort order and sort by to session cache in 
L<Krang::HTMLPager>. [Matt]

=item *

Bugfix in L<Krang::Schedule> - alerts were not being run because 
of some incomplete code meant to check for valid alert id. [Matt]

=item * 

Made changes in media UI to:

=over

=item 1

add 'publish to preview' button and underlying functionality

=item 2

cause 'publish' button in edit screen to also preview the media

Small bugfix to the Solaris C<Platform.pm> [Joseph Sacco]

=item *

C<bin/krang_upgrade> now supports remote MySQL databases.  [Aaron
Ross]

=item *

Bugfix for C<bin/krang_publish>, now correctly counts media total
and time with --to-preview option. [Matt]

=item *

Added C<bin/krang_expunge> - designed to work in conjunction with
C<bin/krang_extract_subset>, it deletes a site from a multi-site Krang
instance, and ensures that no dependencies are left hanging. [Peter]

=item *

Minor bugfix in C<bin/krang_extract_subset> - proper handling of
StoryLink/MediaLink elements that do not point to anything.

=back


=head2 v1.026 - November 4, 2004

=over

=item *

Re-generated templates.kds for the Default and Tutorial element
libraries, making them architecture-independent (see nfreeze note
below).  [Peter]

=item *

Krang now uses C<Storable::nfreeze> rather than C<Storable::freeze>
when saving binary and object data.  The move to C<nfreeze> should
make .kds files architecture-independent, allowing migrations between
different platforms (e.g. x86 / SPARC / PPC).  [Peter]

=item *

Updated L<Storable> to the current release, version 2.13.  [Peter]

=item *

Added C<bin/krang_extract_subset>.  This script is designed to extract
a single site and its' content from a multi-site Krang Instance.
[Peter]

=item *

L<Krang::Story> now handles calls to find() with an arrayref of
site_ids. [Peter]

=item *

L<Krang::Media> now handles calls to find() with an arrayref of
site_ids. [Peter]

=item *

L<Krang::Template> now handles calls to find() with an arrayref of
category_ids. [Peter]

=item * 

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::CGI::Site> that would cause ISE on attempted 
delete if a site had content in its root directory but no had no
other categories [Matt]

=item *

Added population of 'width', 'height', and 'image_dimensions' for 
Krang::ElementClass::MediaLink fill_template. [Matt]

=item *

Bugfixes to L<Krang::CGI::Template> that prevented files from being
uploaded to the edit template screen, and caused ISE when no filename
present. [Matt]

=item *

Bugfixes to L<Krang::Schedule> - checked out or missing objects will
no longer drop large perl-heavy error messages in the logs.  Thanks
for Michael Peters for the initial work to fix it.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::Publisher> - zero-length story output is now
output properly, with a logfile entry to make a note of it.  [Peter]

=item *

Deployed version is now displayed in the template edit UI.
[Michael Peters]

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::Schedule> - scheduling specific versions of a
story or media object for publish now works again.  [Peter]

=item *

Additional documentation!  The long-awaited 
HREF[Creating an Element Library in Krang|building_element_library.html]! [Peter]


=item *

New documentation added -
HREF[Running Krang on the Desktop|krang_on_desktop.html]:
A guide on how to install and run Krang on your local machine.
[Peter]

=item *

Solaris support added!  Tested against Solaris 9, this should also
work against previous versions as well.  Thanks to Joseph Sacco
(jsacco@earthlink.net). [Peter]

=item *

Support for Mac OSX has been added!  Currently tested against 10.3.5,
let us know if it works on other versions!  Thanks to Matthew Wood
(matt@nomorefluffybunny.com).  [Peter]

=item *

C<bin/krang_info> now gives story/media stats for each

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::ElementClass::StoryLink> where elements that
were never linked to stories no longer throw an error, but return
cleanly.  [Michael Peters]

=item *

Mandrake support has been added!  [Matt]

=item *

Fixed browser detection to deal with 1.0 prerelease of Firefox, which
gives a version number of 0.10.  [Aaron Ross]

=back

=head2 v1.025 - October 1, 2004

=over

=item *

Cleaned up error handling in L<Krang::Publisher> and the
C<bin/krang_publish> script - errors are now trapped properly and
reported in a cleaner fashion.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug in the upgrade process of 1.024.  Users who upgraded to
1.024 should immediately upgrade to 1.025.  [Peter]

=item *

C<bin/krang_publish> and C<bin/krang_delete> now properly interact
with hidden stories. [Peter]

=back


=head2 v1.024 - September 24, 2004

=item *

Send HTTP header with root menu. [Aaron Ross]

=item *

Escape values on login page to foil cross-site scripting attacks. [Perrin]

=item *

Add option to show 100 results per page. [Perrin]

=item *

Restructured the index page in docs/ - added a 'User' section, moved a
few things around to make things easier for new users. [Peter]

=item *

Added C<bin/krang_info> - a simple command-line script to list the
currently configured status of Krang.  [Peter]

=item *

Reordered subroutine exports in L<Krang::Element> to fix a library
loading loop that cropped up under some circumstances.  Thanks to
Michael Peters (mpeters@plusthree.com) for finding it.  [Peter]


=item *

Added support for hidden stories, based on class definitions.  A
hidden story is one that, by default, does not show up in calls to
C<find()>.  This is useful for auto-generated story lists where some
types of stories shouldn't be listed.  For example, this will be used
immediately by HREF[Krang Sitemap|/addons.html] and 
HREF[Krang RSS|/addons.html], neither of which should show in most lists.  See
L<Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel> and L<Krang::Story> for more
information.  [Peter]

=item *

Upgraded L<IPC::Run> to 0.78, which is now pseudohash-free (later
versions of Perl complain). [Peter]

=item *

Moved htdocs/help/history.html to htdocs/help/log.html to correct links.
[Perrin]

=item *

Updated L<Imager> to 0.43. [Peter]

=item *

Updated L<HTTP::BrowserDetect> to the latest version, 0.98. [Peter]

=item *

Limited the directories being searched by C<bin/krang_install> when
looking to change execute permissions on a newly-installed backup
file.  There was no need to search a number of potentially large
directory trees, this should improve installation times. [Peter]


=item *

Added C<< published => 1 >> argument to L<Krang::Media> C<find()>
method.  Limits returning objects to those that have been published
before.

=back

=head2 v1.023 - August 31, 2004

=over

=item *

Fixed filenaming in C<krang_backup> to use the correct 2-digit month
(old month values were 00-11, not 01-12). [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug in L<Krang::Media> where thumbnails of certain images were
causing segfaults.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed L<Krang::Story>->C<preview_urls()> to return the correct preview
URL for all sites when a story is associated with multiple sites.
[Peter]


=item *

Made L<Krang::Publisher>->C<additional_content_block()> a lot easier
to use from the developer perspective.  Rather than handling the
result of the call, everything is now handled internally.  Overriding
C<publish()> to use C<additional_content_block> is no longer required.
Additionally, it's backwards-compatible with the old way of doing
things, so no need to make changes to your element libraries.  [Peter]


=item *

Fixed symlink bug that caused thumbnails to disappear from the UI
after a Krang instance was moved to a different location on the
filesystem.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug where deleting a newly-copied story threw an error in the
UI. [Peter]

=item *

Added platform support for Gentoo release 1.5.2, thanks to a patch 
from Fred Moyer (fmoyer@plusthree.com) [Perrin]

=back


=head2 v1.022 - August 6, 2004

=over

=item *

Added support for passing a list of classes to Krang::Story->find().
[Sam]

=item *

Added support for C<publish_category_per_page()> in the publish
process.  This functionality allows element library developers to
generate category template output customized for each page in a
story. [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug where Krang::ElementClass would complain about a missing
template for a sub-element that wasn't actually needed. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug related to the internal tracking of assets in
L<Krang::Publisher>.  This finishes up a minor restructuring that
ensures C<krang_publish> publishes each story/media object only once
during a publish run. [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug in C<krang_publish>.  When publishing with the
C<--site_id> argument, all media objects under that site are now
published, not just those media objects linked to stories. [Peter]

=item *

Cleaned up the code handling the management of internal asset lists in
L<Krang::Publisher>.  This code is used to ensure the same asset is
not published more than once during a publish run. [Peter]

=item *

Added support for searching on C<site_id> in Krang::Media->find().
[Peter]

=item *

Added C<publish_category_per_page()> to
L<Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel>.  This method will soon be used by
L<Krang::Publisher> to determine whether or not to publish category
elements once for each page in a story, or once for all pages in a
story.  [Peter]

=item *

Added automatic height and width data to the Default::image element. 
[Perrin]

=back

=head2 v1.021 - July 21, 2004

=item *

Upped Apache timeout from 30 to 600.  30 seconds was too short to
preview some extremely large stories.  [Peter]

=item *

Errors writing to the filesystem while executing a preview/publish
through the Krang UI are now logged properly in C<logs/krang.log>.
Previously, they were only reported in user-friendly (as opposed to
admin-friendly) fashion to the UI.  [Peter]

=item *

Added indexes on the C<class> and C<published_version> columns in the
C<story> table.  This greatly speeds up searches against these fields.
[Sam]

=item *

Added new method C<use_category_templates()> to
L<Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel>.  This boolean method defaults to
true, and can be used to determine whether or not to wrap story output
in category templates. [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug which caused scheduler problems in upgraded Krang
installs.  Krang::Schedule::Daemon was missing code to reset
REMOTE_USER for each instance.  [Sam]

=item *

Added directory hashing to Krang::Media's XML serialization system.
This allows a single KDS file to contain any number of media files.
The previous limit was 32,000. [Sam]

=item *

Added C<no_parent> option to Krang::ListItem::find(). [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::ListItem::find() which prevented C<ids_only>
from working. [Sam]

=item *

Added missing indexes to the list tables, providing an impressive
speedup in working on large lists. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug that prevented Krang from installing on very recent MySQL
releases which do not tolerate trailing commas in C<CREATE TABLE>
statements. [Aaron Ross]

=item *

Added the ability to run Krang against a MySQL database on a different
machine.  There is a new configuration parameter, C<DBHost>, and a new
option to C<krang_install>, C<--DBHost>.  [Aaron Ross]

=item *

Fixed Krang::CGI::Publisher to not produce a nav-bar when preview
results in an error. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed Krang::User to not load Krang::Group unless it needs to interact
with groups.  This is needed because Krang::Script now uses
Krang::User to run as the 'system' user.  Loading Krang::Group will
cause Krang to load its element libraries, which isn't always a good
thing to do. [Sam]

=back

=head2 v1.020 - Jun 28, 2004

=over

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::ElementClass::Date which prevented the default
method from returning the current date. [Sam]

=item *

Upgraded HTML::Template to the latest release, 2.7, to fix a bug where
a stale template could be returned from the cache under unusual
circumstances. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in the installer which prevented installing using an
element set contained within an add-on. [Sam]

=item *

Added the ability to pass a filename to Krang::ElementClass's
find_template() method.  [Matt]

=item *

Fixed a bug preventing deletions in the List Admin from working
correctly. [Matt]

=item *

Fixed a bug in the FedoraCore1 platform library that would fail to find
chkconfig unless it was in the user's PATH. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where elements using the default Krang::ElementClass
input_form() implementation would eventually cause browsers to slow to
a crawl and eventually crash.  The whole sordid tale is here:
http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=363214 [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where clicking Publish on the Edit Media screen didn't
save changes. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where a story that failed to publish would still get a
'published' log entry.  [Sam]

=item *

Added support for Fedora Core 2. [Sam]

Fixed problem determining C<KRANG_ROOT> on Fedora Core 2 in all
Krang scripts. [Sam]

=back

=head2 v1.019 - Jun 04, 2004

=item *

Fixed bug where C<krang_export> could only write output in directories
where C<KrangUser> had write permissions.  The output file is now
opened before su'ing to C<KrangUser>. [Sam]

=item *

Removed support for C<--append> from C<krang_export>.  This option was
never, to my knowledge, used and it didn't work after the permissions
fix above.  [Sam]

=item *

Changed the schema for the Krang::User XML format to make the new
'hidden' field optional.  This allows data files from pre-v1.017 Krang
to load in later Krangs. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed the v1.018 upgrade module to successfully upgrade instances from
v1.016 and older.  Also made changes to allow repeated runs of the
upgrade module to succeed even if the upgrade stops part way through.
[Sam]

=item *

Changed C<krang_upgrade> to wait till the upgrade is complete before
updating Krang's version number.  This means that failed upgrades can
be re-run and the same upgrade modules will be run again. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed Gentoo Platform tests so that any version of Gentoo 1.4.x now 
works. [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a bug in the error-handling section of Krang::Publisher that was
hiding the real cause of errors during publish.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed broken --republish_only flag in bin/krang_publish. [Peter]

=item *

Changed the default of Krang::ElementClass::Date so that dates are updated 
when the default() method is called and not when new() is called.


=item *

Made Krang::Story::find(published=>1) work with stories that had a published 
version of 1/0 instead of NOT NULL / NULL.

=item *

Fixed Krang::XML::Writer to allow raw tabs in XML without Base64
encoding. [Sam]

=item *

Added a workaround for a very strange seg-fault bug.  [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where after upgrading to v1.018 old users don't show up in
the User Admin list screen. [Sam]

=item *

Changed Krang::Site so that only the site's URL is required to be
unique.  Requiring all four fields to be unique, while seemingly
sensible, causes numerous problems during data imports.  If necessary
we could add these checks back in at the UI level in Krang::CGI::Site.
[Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::Contrib's full_name() that would add ", " to the
end of the name when the contributor had an empty suffix. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::Publisher where no file would be written if the
story's output contained only whitespace or was empty. [Sam]

=item *

Bugfix related to the publish changes made in 1.017 - assets linked to
a story being previewed from an edit interface are now marked
properly.  Media objects are now marked properly when previewed. [Peter]

=item *

Replaced Archive::Tar in Krang::DataSet->new with the system 'tar' for a 50x 
speedup in untaring. [Rudy]

=item *

Removed code from Krang::Contrib that disallowed stories with existing
historical contrib-contrib_type pairs to preview/publish. [Matt]

=back

=head2 v1.018 - May 10, 2004

=item *

Fixed permissions error during upgrade backup creation. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where permissions were not being applied to the Find Link
and Active list screens. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::Group which caused root-category permissions to
be randomized during rebuild_category_cache().  [Sam]

=item *

Added C<--no-backup> option to C<krang_upgrade>. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug in C<bin/krang_publish> where unknown errors during story
publish would trigger an exit without any kind of useful message.  The
error is now printed to STDERR. [Peter]

=item *

Changed Krang to log and drop elements which exceed the maximum
allowed by their parent element.  This mirrors the behavior for
elements with illegal class names.  This allows for an easier element
set development process at the risk of possible data loss, which is
somewhat mitigated by the built in revision system. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed Krang::ElementLibrary to return a sorted list from top_levels().
This results in a sorted list or article types in the UI.  [Sam]

=item *

Added a new hidden user called 'system' which is now used by
Krang::Script.  This means you can now delete the 'admin' user with
impunity. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel::publish_check() was not
being checked by Krang::Schedule.  Stories that are marked to not be
published by the scheduler will now have their wishes respected.
[Peter]

=item *

Fixed bug where contributors created by C<krang_import> weren't
searchable in the UI unless they had first, middle and last
names. [Sam]

=item *

Added code to generate HTML documentation for the scripts in
F<bin/>. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where previewing/publishing zero-length stories caused an
error.  [Peter]

=back

=head2 v1.017 - April 29, 2004

=over

=item *

Fixed a bug where C<tmpl_include> calls in templates weren't correctly
searching the category tree in all cases. [Matt]

=item *

Modified Krang::Widget::category_chooser() to take into account
category permissions when building the category chooser.  Also took
advantage of the multiple-root support in HTML::PopupTreeSelect 1.4 to
remove to empty root node from the widget.  [Sam]

=item *

Upgraded HTML::PopupTreeSelect to the latest released version,
1.4. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug in Krang::Group where the category permissions cache
wasn't being correctly rebuilt after group changes were saved. [Sam]

=item *

Added filesystem sanity checks to the Publish checks - If the
story/media object being tested does not exist on the filesystem in
all locations that it should, it's flagged for output, regardless of
versioning.  Also cleaned up some unneeded API cruft.  [Peter]

=item *

Large changes to the publishing engine.  When publishing/previewing a
story, Krang::Publisher will now check all related stories/media to
see if the most recent version of each object has been
published/previewed before.  If so, the object will not be
published/previewed again.  The chosen story/media object will always
be published/previewed.  This is only default behavior in the UI,
scheduled publish jobs and bin/krang_publisher still publish all
content.  Additional parameters have been added to the
Krang::Publisher API to support this functionality, see
L<Krang::Publisher> for more information.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::Contrib where importing a contributor with no
first name or no last name would duplicate the contributor if it
already existed instead of updating. [Sam]

=item *

Added the C<--skip> option to C<krang_import> which exposes the
existing Krang::DataSet::import_all() C<skip_classes> option from the
command-line. [Sam]

=item *

Removed "Delete Checked" button from List Admin screen.  Lists cannot
be deleted. [Sam]

=item *

Added Krang::Story->preview_version(), Krang::Media->preview_version
and Krang::ElementClass::TopLevel->force_republish() in anticipation
of forthcoming improvements to the publishing system. [Peter]


=item *

Upgraded XML::Validator::Schema to the latest release, 1.06. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed Krang::Story->preview_path() to use the submitted category
argument.  This was keeping preview from writing out content to
multiple sites. [Peter]

=item *

Added password-length check to My Preferences, enforcing the
6-character minimum length on passwords that exists everywhere else in
the UI.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed error reporting in the publish process - error messages are
displayed in a more user-friendly fashion.[Peter]

=item *

Fixed Krang::ElementClass->publish() to trap errors thrown by
HTML::Template::Expr->output(), and fixed Krang::CGI::Publisher to
properly report errors and not try to redirect users when failures
occur in preview.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed krang_ftpd to setup higher file and memory limits.  These limits
were preventing the FTP server from operating on some systems. [Sam]

=back

=head2 v1.016 - April 20, 2004

=over

=item *

Fixed Krang::DB to always turn on mysql_auto_reconnect (it was already
on by default under mod_perl).  This should prevent the schedule
daemon from periodically dying when a database connections times out.
[Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug in Krang::ElementClass which would fail to setup
"is_$element" template vars if "$element" wasn't used as a template
var itself. [Matt]

=item *

Changed site editor to allow colons so that port numbers can be
specified for preview URLs. [Perrin]

=item *

Synchronized Devel-StackTrace with latest from CPAN, so that we are
now using the standard release. [Perrin]

=item *

t/group.t now uses Krang::Test::Content to generate random content,
rather than bin/krang_floodfill. [Peter]

=item *

More comprehensive FreeBSD support.  Krang now works on FreeBSD 4.9
and 5.2.1, and should work on versions between and previous to that
(as long as the appropriate dependencies are in place).  [Peter]

=item *

ftpserver.t now uses Krang::Test::Content.  Simplifies cleanup, and
fixes a bug where ftpserver tests would fail if krang_install used the
--AdminPassword argument (a user is now created for the purposes of
testing). [Peter]

=item *

Added Krang::User creation/destruction to Krang::Test::Content -
furthering the goal that Krang::Test::Content should be able to create
all parts of a site randomly, and clean up everything properly at the
end. [Peter]

=item *

Modified Krang::Contrib::deserialize_xml() to create contributor types
as needed.  [Sam]

=item *

Changed Krang::ElementClass::Date to store and load data in XML using
an ISO-8601 date-time format. Also added missing template_data()
method.  [Sam]

=item *

Added support for Debian. [Jason Purdy]

=item *

Fixed bug where clicking on a media link in the element editor would
open a new window every time. [Sam]

=item *

Moved code to run tests from Makefile into bin/krang_test.  This
allows krang_install to affect which Perl binary runs the tests. It
also helps with BSD portability since the test target didn't work with
BSD make. [Sam]

=head2 v1.015 - April 8, 2004

=item *

Added a message to remind users that they must create a site before
adding stories, media or templates. [Sam]

=item *

Added initial support for FreeBSD!  Currently it only supports FreeBSD
5.2.1 with GNU make (gmake) installed, as that was the only available
testable environment.  Would be nice if someone with more experience
in BSD Makefiles could get Krang's Makefiles to work with BSD make.
There should be nothing keeping Krang from working with earlier
versions of FreeBSD, but that will require someone to pick up the BSD
ball and run with it.  [Peter]

=item *

Fixed site editor to check that URLs don't have paths attached to them
and that paths are absolute. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed krang_upgrade to use Krang::Platform.  Added a new method to
Krang::Platform, post_upgrade_message(). [Sam]

=item *

Upgraded XML-Writer, HTML-Parser, and Tar-Archive to get rid of warnings.
[Perrin]

=item *

Upgraded mod_perl and apache to latest releases. [Perrin]

=item *

Fixed the behavior of Krang::Publisher->preview_story().  Following
the original spec, it now writes the story out to all categories in
the preview path.  Fixed Krang::Story->preview_path as well. [Peter]

=item *

Upgraded Test::Harness to 2.40 to enable warnings during tests.  Fixed
a number of warnings in the test files. [Perrin] [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where schedule tests would fail frequently due to
krang_schedulectl leaving bad PID files around.  Also made the
schedule tests quiet unless an error occurs. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where using a category_trail_loop in a category element
template produced an ISE. [Sam]

=item *

Added support for Fedora Core 1. [Perrin Harkins]

=item *

Moved Krang user/group creation from krang_install to Krang::Platform.
This can now be overridden on a platform-by-platform basis. [Peter]

=item *

Created Krang::Platform->find_bin().  Use of this sub now needs to be
propagated throughout krang_install along with Krang::Platform and its
derivatives - it searches $PATH for the full path for the executable
you're trying to run. [Peter]



=item *

Moved the final installation message out of bin/krang_install, created
Krang::Platform->post_install_message() that generates the same output.
This can now be overridden & extended on a platform-specific basis. [Peter]

=item *

Split the various checks out of Krang::Platform->verify_dependencies().
This will simplify ports to other platforms, as individual checks can
now be overridden, rather than the entire sub. [Peter]

=item *

Added new default scheduled job to analyze DB tables nightly.  This
greatly improves performance for large databases. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed bug where default scheduled jobs (tmp cleaner and session
expiration) weren't being run for new installations. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed krang_createdb to stop after the first failed system
call. [Scott Lanning]

=item *

Added enhanced cache debugging code and a last-resort check in an
Apache log_handler to make sure the cache is off at the end of the
request. [Sam]

=item *

Moved setup of /etc/init.d link from krang_install into the Redhat
platform modules' finish_installation() methods.  This should allow
the Gentoo and Debian ports to proceed. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed build and installation system to work with a Perl that isn't
called 'perl' and in your path.  So, for example, if you've got a
binary called 'perl5.8.0' you can build Krang with it and install with
it. [Sam]

=item *

Added initial support for Gentoo 1.4.3. [Peter]

=item *

Updated porting.pod with steps that might really work. [Sam]

=item *

Fixed a bug where an error occurring during preview triggered a
Krang::Cache error which corrupted the display. [Sam]

=item *

Improved error message generated when InstanceElementSet is set to an
element set that isn't installed. [Peter]

=item *

Fixed a ton of whitespace in module source files which was breaking
the POD output. [Peter]
