<h2>Archived Templates - Advanced/Simple</h2>
<p>
Use Archived Templates, to search Krang for archived Templates. By
using search terms and keywords, you can run specific searches for
individual or multiple templates.
</p>

<p>
There are two search modes:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Simple:</b> The default search is very simple: just enter a
title, URL or keyword and click <i>Search</i>. For a complete list of
Templates, leave the space blank and click <i>Search</i>.</li>

<li><b>Advanced:</b> This search allows you to be more specific about
the Template you're trying to find. Fill in any or all of the fields
and click <i>Search</i>. To restart your search with a fresh page,
click <i>Clear</i>.<br/>

When searching by Template ID, you may also
find live or trashed templates.  For live templates the status
column will indicate 'Live', for trashed templates, 'Trash'.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
After completing your Search and finding the Template you are looking
for, you can View, Unarchive or Delete the Template (depending on your
permission set).
</p>
<p>
If you didn't find what you are looking for, you may click <i>Search
in Live</i> to start the same search in the live Krang.
