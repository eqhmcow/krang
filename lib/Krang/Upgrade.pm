=head1 NAME

Krang::Upgrade - superclass for Krang upgrade modules


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Krang::ClassLoader base => 'Upgrade';


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is intended to be used as a parent class for Krang upgrade
modules.  It implements a harness for calling the C<per_installation()> 
and C<per_instance()> methods.


=head1 INTERFACE

To use this module, there are three things you have to do:


=over 4

=item use Krang::ClassLoader base => 'Upgrade';

This causes your upgrade module (e.g., "V1_23.pm") to inherit
certain basic functionality.  Specifically, an C<upgrade()>
method which calls C<per_installation()>, and then calls
C<per_instance()> once for each instance.


=item per_installation()

You must implement this method in your upgrade module.  This method
is called once per upgrade, before the C<per_instance()> method is called.

This method is called (as an object method) by the inherited upgrade() method.


=item per_instance()

You must implement this method in your upgrade module.  This method
is called once per Krang instance, after the C<per_installation()> 
method is called.

This method is called (as an object method) by the inherited upgrade() method.

=back


=head2 INHERITED METHODS

=over 4


=item new()

The new() method is a constructor which creates a trivial object from a
hash.  Your upgrade modules may use this to store state information.


=item upgrade()

The upgrade() method is called by the krang_upgrade script to implement
an upgrade.  This method calls C<per_installation()>, and then calls 
C<per_instance()> once for each installed instance.

The following named parameters may be passed which will then get passed
along to C<per_installation()> and C<per_instance()>.

=over

=item * no_db

This tells the upgrade module that the upgrade should not make changes to
the database.

=back

=item remove_files()

This convenience method is provided to help remove old files during
the upgrade.  It's best to call this method in the
C<per_installation()> method since files are per-installation. File
names are given relative to C<KRANG_ROOT>. If a directory name is
passed to this method, the directory and all its content will be
deleted recursively.

    $self->remove_files(
        'lib/Krang/Foo.pm',
        'src/Foo-1.00.tar.gz',
    );
