=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides methods to operate on story objects.  A story
contains some story-specific data (title, cover date, etc.) and an
element tree rooted in C<element>, an object of the L<Krang::Element>
class.

Stories may be associated with contributors (objects of
L<Krang::Contrib>) and assigned scheduled actions (publish and
expire).

Stories are checked-in, checked-out and versioned like media
(L<Krang::Media>) and templates (L<Krang::Template>).  However, unlike
media and templates, they may also be moved to desks (L<Krang::Desk>).

Stories may be assigned to multiple categories.  However, one category
is the primary category and determines the primary URL.

=head1 INTERFACE

=head2 Attributes

Story objects are composed of the following attributes.  Unless
otherwise noted all attributes are accessible via standard
accessor/mutators.  For example, the C<title> attribute can be set
with:

  $story->title("New title here");

And accessed with:

  $title = $story->title();

If an attribute is marked (readonly) then its value cannot be set.
For example, you may not set C<checked_out> directly; instead, call
the checkout() method.

=over

=item C<story_id> (readonly)

=item C<title>

=item C<slug>

=item C<notes>

=item C<priority>

A number from 1 (meaning low priority) to 3 (meaning high priority).

=item C<cover_date>

A Time::Piece object representing an arbitrary cover date.

=item C<publish_date>

A Time::Piece object containing the date and time this story was last
published.

=item C<version> (readonly)

=item C<published_version> (readonly)

=item C<category> (readonly)

The primary category for the story.  C<undef> until at least one
category is assigned.  This is just a convenience method that returns
the first category in C<categories>.

=cut

sub category {
    my $self = shift;

    # return from the category cache if available
    return $self->{category_cache}[0]
      if $self->{category_cache} and $self->{category_cache}[0];

    # otherwise, lookup from id list
    my ($category) = 
      Krang::Category->find(category_id => $self->{category_ids}[0]);
    $self->{category_cache}[0] = $category;

    return $category;
}

=item C<url> (readonly)

The primary URL for the story.  C<undef> until at least one category
is assigned.

=cut

sub url {
    my $self = shift;
    croak "illegal attempt to set readonly attribute 'url'.\n"
      if @_;
    
    # return from the url cache if available
    return $self->{url_cache}[0]
      if $self->{url_cache} and $self->{url_cache}[0];

    # otherwise, compute using element 
    my $url = $self->element->build_url(story => $self,
                                        category => $self->category);
    $self->{url_cache}[0] = $url;

    return $url;
}

=item C<categories>

A list of category objects associated with the story.  The first
category in this list is the primary category.

This attribute may be assigned with category_ids or Krang::Category
objects.  Only objects will be returned.

This attribute may be set with a list or an array-ref.  For example:

  # same result
  $story->categories(1024, 1028);
  $story->categories([1024, 1028]);

But a list of objects is always returned:

  @categories = $story->categories;

This method may throw a Krang::Story::DuplicateURL exception if you
add a new category and it generates a duplicate URL.  When this
exception is thrown the category list is still changed and you may
continue to operate on the story.  However, if you try to call save()
you will receive the same exception.

=cut

    my $self = shift;

=item C<contribs>

=head2 Methods

=over

=item C<< $story = Krang::Story->new(class => 'Article', categories => [$cat, 1024, 1034], slug => "foo", title => "Foo") >>

Creates a new story object.  Any object attribute listed can be set in
new(), but C<class>, C<categories>, C<slug> and C<title> are all
required.  After this call the object is guaranteed to be in a valid
state and may be saved immediately with C<save()>.

Will throw a Krang::Story::DuplicateURL exception with a story_id
field if saving this story would conflict with an existing story.

=item $story->contribs(@contribs);

Called with no arguments, returns a list of contributor
(Krang::Contrib) objects.  These objects will have
C<selected_contrib_type> set according to their use with this story
object.

May be set two ways.  First, a contributor may specified as a two-key
hash containing the contrib_id and the contrib_type_id for the
contributor.  A single contributor can be present in the list multiple
times with different contrib_type_ids.

Second, a list of contributor objects with selected_contrib_type() set
may be passed in.

permanent changes in the database (checkin/checkout make transient
changes).  Increments the version number unless called with

=item C<< $count = Krang::Story->find(title => "Turtle Soup", count => 1) >>

Finds stories in the database based on supplied criteria.  

Fields may be matched using SQL matching.  Appending "_like" to a
field name will specify a case-insensitive SQL match.  For example, to
match a sub-string inside title:

  @stories = Krang::Story->find(title_like => '%' . $search . '%');

Notice that it is necessary to surround terms with '%' to perform
sub-string matches.

Available search options are:

=over

=item title 

Search by title.

=item slug 

Search by slug.

=item url 

Search by url.

=item primary_url 

Search by primary url.

=item category_id

Find stories by category.

=item primary_category_id

Find stories by category, looking only at the primary location.

=item site_id

Find stories by site.

=item primary_site_id

Find stories by site, looking only at the primary location.

=item checked_out

Set to 0 to find only non-checked-out stories.  Set to 1 to find only
checked out stories.  The default, C<undef> returns all stories.

=item checked_out_by

Set to a user_id to find stories checked-out by a user.

=item contributor_id

Set to a contributor_id to find stories associated with that contributor.  B<NOT IMPLEMENTED>

=item link_to_story

Set to a story_id to find stories that link to a specified story.  B<NOT IMPLEMENTED>

=item link_to_media

Set to a media_id to find stories that link to a specified media
object. B<NOT IMPLEMENTED>

=item cover_date

May be either a single date (a L<Time::Piece::MySQL> object) or an
array of dates specifying a range.  In ranges either member may be
C<undef>, specifying no limit in that direction.

=item publish_date

May be either a single date (a L<Time::Piece::MySQL> object) or an
array of dates specifying a range.  In ranges either member may be
C<undef>, specifying no limit in that direction.

=item story_id

Load a story by ID.  Given an array of story IDs, loads all the identified
stories.

=item version

Combined with C<story_id> (and only C<story_id>), loads a specific
version of a story.  Unlike C<revert()>, this object has C<version>
set to the actual version number of the loaded object.

=item simple_search

Performs a per-word LIKE match against title and URL, and an exact

Options affecting the search and the results returned:

=over

=item ids_only

Return only IDs, not full story objects.

=item count

Return just a count of the results for this query.

=item limit

Return no more than this many results.

=item offset

Start return results at this offset into the result set.

=item order_by

Output field to sort by.  Defaults to 'story_id'.

=item order_desc

Results will be in sorted in ascending order unless this is set to 1
(making them descending).
