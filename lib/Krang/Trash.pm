=head1 NAME

Krang::Trash - data broker for TrashBin CGI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Krang::ClassLoader 'Trash';

  # get a list of objects on the current user's workspace
  @objects = pkg('Trash')->find();

  # get just the first 10, sorting by url:
  @objects = pkg('Trash')->find(limit    => 10,
                                offset   => 0,
                                order_by => 'url');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a find() method which returns all objects living
in the trashbin. These are not full-fledged Story/Media/Template
objects, just hashes containing what we need to fill the trashbin's
pager view.

=head1 INTERFACE

=over

=item C<< @objects = Krang::Trash->find() >>

=item C<< $count = Krang::Trash->find(count => 1) >>

Finds stories, media and templates currently living the trashbin.  The
returned array will contain Krang::Story, Krang::Media and
Krang::Template objects slimmed down to Trash objects.  Custom objects
may also be listed (see the class method C<register_find_sql()>).

Since the returned objects do not share single ID-space, the standard
C<ids_only> mode is not supported.

Available search options are:

=over

=item count

Return just a count of the results for this query.

=item limit

Return no more than this many results.

=item offset

Start return results at this offset into the result set.

=item order_by

Output field to sort by.  Defaults to 'type' which sorts stories
first, then media and finally templates.  Other available settings are
'date', 'title', 'url' and 'id'.

=item order_desc

Results will be in sorted in ascending order unless this is set to 1
(making them descending).

SQL

=item C<< pkg('Trash')->register_find_sql(object => $moniker, user_sensitive => 0, sql => $sql) >>

This class method allows custom objects other than Krang's core
objects Story, Media and Template to register with the trashbin's
find() method.  It should be called in a BEGIN block!

=back

=head2 ARGUMENTS

=over

=item object

This should be the lowercase moniker of your object's class,
e.g. 'mailing' for Krang::Mailing.

=item sql

This should be the SQL query used to find those objects in the
trashbin.

=item user_sensitive

Set this flag to true if the sql argument includes a placeholder for
the logged in user's ID. Defaults to 0.

=back

=head2 Example: A custom object class named "Krang::Mailing"

The SQL select command forms a fassade, mapping asset fields to trash
object fields.  Order matters!  All fields must be present, though
they might contain the empty string (as the 'class' field in the
example below.

Also assumed in the custom objects' database table is the presence of
a boolean column named 'trashed', which is supposed to be set to true
if the object currently lives in the trashbin.

 Class:   Krang::Mailing
 Table:   mailing

 BEGIN {

     pkg('Trash')->register_find_sql(object => 'mailing', user_sensitive => 0, sql => <<SQL);
 SELECT mailing_id   AS id,
        'mailing'    AS type,
        subject      AS title,
        ''           AS class,
        url          AS url,
        mailing_date AS date,
        ''           AS version,
        someperm     AS may_see,
        otherperm    AS may_edit,

Prune the trash, deleting the oldest entries, leaving TrashMaxItems.

This class method is currently called at the end of each object delete
(i.e. when moving an object into the trash).

=over

=item Potential Security Hole

Users without admin_delete permission may delete assets by creating
bogus objects and pushing them into the trash, thus causing prune() to
permanently delete trashed objects!

Deletes the specified object from the trashbin, i.e. deletes it

Restores the specified object from the trashbin back to live or to the
retired section (depending from where it has been deleted).  The object must
implement a method named C<untrash()> that does the heavy lifting.
