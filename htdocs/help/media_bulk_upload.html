Two alternatives exist to using the Krang Media interface to add new media.<br><br>

First, you may use Internet Explorer's FTP client, or an external FTP client. Connect using the FTP link below.  Navigate to the files on your computer, then transfer them to your Media file system.<br><br>

You may also upload many media files at once using the Archive Upload.  Acceptable archive types are .zip, .sit, or .tar.  Within an archive, you can have a directory structure for placing media within Krang categories.  By default, if the directories within the archive do match categories in Krang, the upload will fail.  However, new categories can be created on the fly, if you use the checkbox to choose this option. <br><br>

When the either upload process is finished, all Media will appear in the PIRT CMS. Go to Find Media to search for a particular file.<br><br>
