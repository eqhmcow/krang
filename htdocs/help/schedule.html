At the bottom of the Edit Story page, clicking on <i>Publish</i> will publish your Story immediately. However, you can also schedule your Story to publish at a specific time or day. Click on <i>Schedule</i> at the top of the page to go to the Story Schedule Editor.<br><br>

<span class="helpsubhead">Simple</span><br><br>
 The Story Schedule Editor defaults to a Simple view. Within the Simple View you can schedule your Story to be published at a later day. From the dropdown menus select Month, Day, Year, Hour, Minute, AM or PM. Click on <i>Add to Schedule</i>. Your story will be published at this future date.<br><br>

You can also specify a Version for publish. The publish scheduler defaults to the Newest Version, but if you want a different version to publish at a certain time, you can select a different version from the dropdown menu.<br><br>

To schedule more advanced functions, click on <i>Advanced Schedule</i>.<br><br>


<span class="helpsubhead">Advanced Schedule</span><br><br>
Advanced schedules allows you to publish a Story at a pre-determined time monthly, weekly, daily or hourly.  Select the radio button for the time you choose, then select from the dropdowns, the day hour or month.<br><br>

Then select the Version, either the Newest version or a previous one. From the Advanced Schedule page, you a can also Expire your Stories. Essentially, to expire, means to delete from the file system and remove from the Internet. Expired Stories will still appear in the CMS. To expire a Story, follow the same process for Publish, except choose Expire from the Action drop down menu.<br><br>

Click <i>Return</i> to return to the Edit Story page.<br><br>
