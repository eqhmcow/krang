<h2>Site Management</h2>
<p>
A Site is your web site where content items are published. In Krang, you must first create a Site, then create <a href="help.pl?topic=category" class="helplink">Categories</a> within a Site. Sites are usually created by a CMS administrator.
</p>

<p>
The site admin defaults to the Site List page. This page lists all the Categories in the system. Additionally, you can:
</p>

<ul>
<b>Search:</b>Search for a Site by site name.</li>
<b>Add:</b>Click on <i>Add A Site</i>, enter in the requested information and click <i>Save</i> to save your Site.</li>
<b>Edit:</b> Click on <i>Edit</i> to make changes to your Site.</li>
<b>Delete:</b> To delete a Site, check the check box and click on <i>Delete Checked</i>.</li>
</ul>
