<h2>Find Templates - Advanced/Simple</h2>
<p>
Use Find Templates, to search Krang for live Templates. By using
search terms and keywords, you can run specific searches for
individual or multiple templates.
</p>

<p>
There are two Find Template interfaces.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Simple:</b> The default search is very simple: just enter a
title, URL or keyword and click <i>Search</i>. (To include the actual 
content of templates in your search, click 'Search full text?') 
For a complete list of Templates, leave the space blank and click 
<i>Search</i>.</li>

<li><b>Advanced:</b> This search allows you to be more specific about
the Template you're trying to find. Fill in any or all of the fields
and click <i>Search</i>. To restart your search with a fresh page,
click <i>Clear</i>.<br/>

When searching by Template ID, you may also find archived or trashed templates.  
For archived templates the status column will indicate 'Archive', for trashed 
templates, 'Trash'.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
After completing your Search and finding the Template you are looking
for, you can View, Edit, Archive, Deploy or Delete the Template
(depending on your permission set).
</p>

<p>
If you didn't find what you are looking for, you may click <i>Search
in Archive</i> to start the same search in the Archive.
</p>

<b>Note Regarding Full-Text Searches</b><br>
Phrases can be put in quotation marks if you wish to find Stories that contain the 
whole phrase rather than the individual words. Also, although the default search 
matches partial words, you can request full-word matches only by quoting the text 
and including whitespace - for example, " word " will not match "wordsmith", but 
will match "word" even if it appears at the beginning or end of a sentence.
