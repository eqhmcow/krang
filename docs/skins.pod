=head1 Skinning Krang

Krang's appearance can be modified by creating a skin.  The simplest
skins just change the Krang's color pallette, but more advanced skins
can totally revise Krang's user interface.  This document will teach
you how to build a Krang skin.

=head1 A Simple Skin

The simplest possible skin consists of a single file, called
F<skin.conf> places in a directory underneath the F<skins/> directory.
For example, to create a skin called 'Red' a directory called
F<skins/Red> must be created:

  mkdir skins/Red

The F<skins/Red/skin.conf> file will contain the basic configuration
information for the skin.  For example, here's one that changes
Krang's colors to shades of red:

  # based on the Default skin
  Include ../Default/skin.conf

  # change palette to reds
  dark_color       #660002
  light_color      #eba4a5
  bright_color     #ff0004

  # text colors to match the red palette
  text_color       #333333
  light_text_color #ffffff
  link_color       #660002

The C<Include> directive brings in all the default settings from the
C<Default/skin.conf> file.  This is useful if you don't want to define
all the required settings.  The remaining lines configure Krang to use
shades of red in the UI.

To use this skin, first change the configured skin in your
F<conf/krang.conf> file:

  Skin Red

To activate the skin, restart Krang:

  bin/krang_ctl restart

Now when you login to Krang with your browser you'll see a red interface.

=head1 Dealing with Images

Actually, what you'll see after following the instructions in the last
 section is a red webpage with some blue images.  Krang uses images
for interface highlights like the arrow that shows you which direction
a column is being sorted.  These images will need special attention to
match the current theme.

One option is to simply set C<image_color> in your F<skin.conf>.  This
will cause Krang to color in some default greyscale images with a
color of your choice.  For example, the Red theme might contain:

  # color the images dark red
  image_color      #660002
