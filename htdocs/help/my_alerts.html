<h2>My Alerts</h2>
<p>
You can alert fellow users of your CMS to certain actions by setting up an Alert. Alerts will send an email to a user if the action specified occurs. The different actions that alerts can be set for are:
</p>

<ul
<li>Check In</li>
<li>Check Out</li>
<li>Move To</li>
<li>New </li>
<li>Publish</li>
<li>Save</li>
</ul>

<p>
An alert for one of these actions can be set for Stories, Media, and Templates within a category that you choose during your set up of the Alert. To set up a new Alert, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>From the drop-down menu, select an action from the list.</li>
<li>Choose a Site/Categor</li>
<li>Select a Desk (this is an optional field. Some actions do not require a desk)</li>
<li>Click on <i>Add Aler</li>
</ol>

<p>
To delete, edit, or create new alerts at any time, click on <i>My Alerts</i> in the left navigation.
