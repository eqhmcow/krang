Within the PIRT CMS, all written content is considered a Story. Whether it's a feature article or your web site's Homepage, using this tool will get you started creating new content.<br><br>

Each Story that is created in the PIRT CMS will have unique elements and specific features that you pick and choose from as you build your Story.<br><br>

The first items associated with a Story are the Properties that you select/enter on the 'New Story' page.<br><br>

<b>Type:</b> Type refers to your Story Type. Select the type of Story you'd like to create, such as Feature Article. Story Type is a required field.<br>
<b>Title:</b> This is the Title of your Story. Depending on the Story Type it may appear directly in the output. The Title is a required field.<br>
<b>Slug:</b> A one-word identifier used as the last part of the Story's URI, and the directory in which the story resides.  Some Story Types require a slug. Essentially, this is the story's filename and will appear in the URL of the page. The slug must be unique.<br>
<b>Cover Date:</b> When creating a New Story, select a Cover Date. The cover Date defaults to the current date and time, but it can be modified to a future or previous date. The cover date is a required field and may appear on some Story Types directly in the URL or the page.<br>

<b>Site/Category:</b> Every Story must be located in a site and category. Select the appropriate file path by clicking <i>Choose</i>. Then select a site and category from the popup window. A site/category is a required field.<br><br>

After the above information is entered, click on <i>Create</i>, this will take you to the next step in Creating a New Story.<br><br>

<i>Reset</i> and <i>Cancel</i> are also available. Resetting will delete all text from the text boxes on this page. Canceling will return you to My Workspace and not Save any of the information entered.<br><br>
