=head1 Krang Todo List

The following are bugfixes/enhancements in Krang that we're looking to
address.  If there are more items that should go on the list, if you
want to help, let us know!

=head2 HTML-Only Items

These issues are entirely in the UI, and can be addressed by
knowlegable HTML people, without any interaction with perl code.

=over

=item Enlarge Contributor Bio box on Contributor page (1.027)

=item Enlarge Template Text Area box in Template editor pages (1.027)

=item Making the Category Chooser Box resizeable (1.027)

This may require perl work in L<Krang::Widget> as well.

=item Changes to Save functionality (1.027)

To help prevent lost saves, the message in the JavaScript window should
say:

  "Save Changes to Story?"

There will be 3 options:

=over

=item 1 Yes

Yes, will save the changes and send you to the desired page.

=item 2 No

No, will not save the changes and send you to the desired page.

=back

=item Moving the Delete Button (1.027)

The delete button will be moved on the following pages:

  Find Media ('Delete Checked')
  Edit Story page
  Edit Element page

The Delete Button will be removed from the file box on the My
Workspace page.

=back

=head2 HTML/Perl Items

These items are UI issues, but require changes to the underlying Perl
code to make them happen.

=over



=item Adding Publish Buttons (1.027)

Publish buttons will be added to the following pages:

  Find Media
  Find Stories
  Find Templates


=item Adding Checkout to Find Media (1.027)


=item Media Publish to Preview (1.027)

Publishing a media object to the live site should also publish it in
the preview site.

=item Element Re-Order Function (1.027)

Clicking the "Save" button after re-ordering story elements should
save the new order as well as the story content.

Note that the Re-Order button should not be removed until
Dev changes the save function.

=item Sort Keywords (1.027)

Keywords should sort alphabetically in list manager.

=item Search Functionality (1.027)

These are enhancements to how Find Stories/Find Media is handled in
the Krang CMS User Interface.

=over

=item Remember Search type (Advanced vs. Simple).

=item Remember previous find and populate search results.

=item Remember sort order of search results

=item Media Advanced Search should be able to search on Alt Tags.

=item Searching on Alt Tags in Media Advanced Search

=item New Template - Element Chooser (future)

When creating a new template - the element chooser pulldown is nearly
useless - it doesn't offer any concept of context.

The pulldown should be replaced with a Category-Chooser-style Element
Chooser, one that shows the hierarchtical relationships between
elements.  The current category chooser (built by L<Krang::Widget>)
can be used as a guide.



=item Fixing Stylesheet issues in the Krang UI/Making Krang resizeable (future).

At the moment, the Krang UI is fixed at 800 pixels wide, and has
chunks that make it incompatible with certain browsers (IE 5 on the
Mac is one example).

There are a number of flaws in Krang's HTML/CSS that need to be
corrected - some are template-based, others are in the HTML built by
various perl modules (L<Krang::Pager> for one).

The final goal would be a cleaner HTML/CSS implementation of the UI
that would support more browsers and be easier to maintain and skin in
the long run.

=back

=head2 Dev-only Items

The following are perl-only issues.

=over

=item New Story - Story Type pulldown should be alphabetized.

The Story-Type pulldown should be in alphabetical order.

=item System Administrator Functions

=over

=item Full publish via Krang Scheduler (1.027)

Allow Krang Scheduler to specify C<site_id> or C<category_id> for
scheduled publish.

=item krang_publish Enhancements (1.027)

Allow the C<--media-only> option to work in conjunction with the
C<--site_id> option and publish only media in that site.

=back


=item Krang::ElementClass::HTMLArea (1.027?)

Adding a new elementclass of HTMLArea.  Behavior would be akin to
Krang::ElementClass::TextArea, but it would use
HREF[HTMLArea|http://www.dynarch.com/projects/htmlarea/] to give
developers a limited (but configurable by element developers) set of
HTML widgets for formatting.


=item FTP Publish (future)

Sending preview/publish output to a remote FTP server.


=item Default fill_template() capability (1.027?  1.028 more likely)

L<Krang::ElementClass>->fill_template() will be expanded to make it
possible to populate an element's template with all children down to
an arbitrary depth.

=item Cleaning MD5 Salt issues (1.027?).

The MD5 Salt should be built at install.  Care is needed to make sure
this doesn't break existing installs on upgrade.

=back
