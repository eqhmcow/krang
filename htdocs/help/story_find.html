<h2>Find Story - Advanced/Simple</h2>

<p>
Use Find Story, to search Krang for live stories. By using search terms and
keywords, you can run specific searches for individual or multiple
stories.
</p>

<p>
There are two Find Story interfaces.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Simple:</b> The default search is very simple: just enter a
title, URL or keyword and click <i>Search</i>. (To include the actual 
content of Stories in your search, click 'Search full text?') For a 
complete list of Stories, leave the space blank and click <i>Search</i>.</li>

<li><b>Advanced:</b> This search allows you to be more specific about
the Story you're trying to find. Fill in any or all of the fields and
click <i>Search</i>. To restart your search with a fresh page, click
<i>Clear</i>.<br/>

When searching by Story ID, you may also find archived or trashed
stories.  For archived stories the status column will indicate
'Archive', for trashed stories, 'Trash'.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
After completing your Search and finding the Story you are looking
for, you can Edit, Check Out, View, Copy, Archive, Publish or Delete
the Story (depending on your permission set).
</p>

<p>
If you didn't find what you are looking for, you may click <i>Search
in Archive</i> to start the same search in the Archive.
</p>

<hr>
<p>
<b>Note Regarding Full-Text Searches</b><br>
Phrases can be put in quotation marks if you wish to find Stories that 
contain the whole phrase rather than the individual words. Also, although 
the default search matches partial words, you can request full-word matches 
only by quoting the text and including whitespace - for example, " word " 
will not match "wordsmith", but will match "word" even if it appears at 
the beginning or end of a sentence.
