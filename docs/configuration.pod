=head1 Krang Configuration

=head2 Introduction

Krang is configured through a single configuration file called
F<krang.conf>.  Krang finds its configuration file by first looking
for the C<KRANG_CONF> environment variable.  If this is unset, Krang
will look for C<KRANG_ROOT> and append F<conf/krang.conf> to it.  In
most cases Krang can figure out C<KRANG_ROOT> automatically by looking
at the way you started Krang.

Krang's configuration file is in the same format as Apache.  Simple
directives are set using the name and value, separated by a space.
For example:

  KrangRoot /usr/local/krang

Multiple values are separated by spaces.  Example:

  ParentSets Flex Default

If a value contains a space, it must be enclosed in quotes (single or
double):

  InstanceDisplayName "MotorTrendPIRT/CMS, Ultra Super Edition"

Instance blocks in Krang work like VirtualHost blocks in Apache.  For
example, the instance called "truckin" would have a block like:

  <Instance truckin>
     InstanceName truckin
     VirtualHost cms.truckin.com
     # ...
  </Instance>

Just like Apache, configuration directives defined outside the
Instance blocks are inherited by the instances.  This means that
common settings can be defined globally and then selectively
overridden inside the Instance blocks, reducing overall configuration
size.

The actual configuration directives used to configure Krang are
documented inside the C<krang.conf>.
