<span class="helptitle">My Workspace</span><br><br>
My Workspace is your personal space within the PIRT CMS. This is a space that only you as a 'logged in user' can access, it is your home base. This is where you store files that you are working on. These files can be Stories, Media or Templates.<br><br>

Click on <i>My Workspace</i> in the upper left hand corner to return to this screen at any time.<br><br>

If you want to edit a file, you can Check Out the file and click on Edit from 'My Workspace'. Additionally, depending on your permissions you may be able to Edit from other areas of the CMS.<br><br>
<span class="helpsub">Check In/Check Out</span><br>
The PIRT CMS is a Check In/Check Out system. In other words, you must Check Out a file in order to edit it; you must Check In a file for another user to work on the same file.<br><br>

All files that a user has Checked Out will appear on 'My Workspace.'<br><br>

There are three different types of files in the PIRT CMS. They are<br><br>

1)	Media
2)	Stories
3)	Templates
<br><br>
<span class="helpnote">*Depending on the permissions assigned to you, you may or may not have access to all types of files.</span><br><br>

When you Check In or Check Out a Story, the Story originates either from a Search result or from a <a href="desk.html" class="helplink">Desk</a>. Stories are the only types of files that use Desks, neither Media nor Templates do not. These files are either on a user's 'My Workspace' or they are Checked In to the system.<br><br>

When a file appears on 'My Workspace' the following functions are available:<br><br>

<span class="helpsubhead">Media:</span><br>

<b>Publish:</b>  To publish a Media file, click on the <i>Publish</i> button. Publishing will put the file on the Internet.<br>
<b>Check In:</b>  If another member of your team needs to view or edit the Media file, Check In the file by clicking on <i>Check In</i>.<br>

<b>Preview:</b>  Click on the hyperlinked URL. A new window will open to preview the Story.<br>

<b>Delete:</b>  To delete a Story, click on the <i>Delete</i> button.<br>

<b>Delete:</b>  To delete a Template, click on the <i>Delete</i> button.<br>
<b>Test:</b> On My Workspace, you can select 'Test with this template' by checking the checkbox. Doing this allows you to preview Stories that are formatted with this template, but Stories that are published will continue to use the Deployed template versus the template that is being tested.<br>
