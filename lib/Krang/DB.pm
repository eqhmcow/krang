=head1 NAME

Krang::DB - provides access to Krang database

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # get a database handle
  use Krang::DB qw(dbh forget_dbh);
  $dbh = dbh();

  # forget about the current dbh for this instance, triggering a
  # reconnect on the next call to dbh()
  forget_dbh();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use this class to get a DBI handle for the active instance.  If the
database for this instance does not yet exist, it will be created.

=item C<< $dbh = dbh() >>

Returns a DBI handle for the database for the active instance.  The
default options are:

  RaiseError         => 1
  AutoCommit         => 1

This call is guaranteed to return the same database handle on
subsequent calls within the same instance and process.  (Until a call
to forget_dbh(), of course.)

This method will croak() if the database to which a connection is
requested does not match the version of Krang which is currently
installed.  (This is only evaluated when a new connection is opened,
as opposed to retrieved from cache).

If you don't want the database connection to croak you have to call
dbh() with the ignore_version parameter set:

  my $dbh = dbh( ignore_version => 1 );

sub dbh {

    my $name = InstanceDBName;
    croak("Unable to create dbh, InstanceDBName is undefined.\n" . 
          "Maybe you forgot to call Krang::Conf->instance()?")
      unless defined $name;

    # check cache
    return $DBH{$name} if $DBH{$name} and $DBH{$name}->ping;

    # connect to the defined database
    $DBH{$name} = DBI->connect(
                               "DBI:mysql:database=$name".
                               ":mysql_read_default_group=krang", 
                               DBUser, DBPass,
                               { RaiseError           => 1, 
                                 AutoCommit           => 1,
                                 mysql_auto_reconnect => 1,
                               });

    # Check version, unless specifically asked not to
    unless ($args{ignore_version}) {
        my ($db_version) = $DBH{$name}->selectrow_array("select db_version from db_version");
        my $krang_version = $Krang::VERSION;
        die("Database <-> Krang version mismatch! (Krang v$krang_version, DB v$db_version).\n\n Unable to continue.\n")
          unless ($db_version == $krang_version);
    }

    return $DBH{$name};
}






=item C<< forget_dbh() >>

Causes the next call to dbh() to perform a fresh connect.  This is
useful in cases where you know the currently cached dbh() is invalid.
For example, after forking a child process a call to forget_dbh() is
necessary to avoid the parent and child trying to use the same
database connection.
