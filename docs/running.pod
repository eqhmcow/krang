=head1 Running Krang

Running Krang is a guide to setting up Krang and keeping it in good
working order.  It goes beyond merely installing the application,
covering publishing setup and basic operation.  You should read this
after installing Krang for the first time.

=head2 Creating a Site

Every Krang instance needs at least one site to do anything
interesting.  A site controls where content is published and
configures the URLs by which stories and media are identified.

You need to create a site before you can create stories or media.  To
add a site, login as an administrative user and go to the 'Sites'
application within the 'Admin' section of the navigation bar.  Click
on 'Add a Site' and you'll see the interface in Figure 1.

=for html
<div style='margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px; padding: 5px; border: solid #dddddd 1px;'><img src="running_1.png"><br>Figure 1: Add a Site</div>

You must fill in four fields:

=over

=item * URL

This is the primary URL of your site, where users go to access live
content.

=item * Preview URL

This is the private URL where editors will go to see pre-production
output from Krang.

=item * Publish Path

This is the path where Krang will write files which must be served by
the configured URL.

=item * Preview Path

This is the path where Krang will write files which must be served by
the configured Preview URL.

=back

Now when an editor previews or publishes a story it will be written to
the paths you configured.

=head2 Preview and Publish Setup

The values configured for a site must correspond to the setup of
another web server.  This is because Krang is not a front-end web
server.  Krang works by publishing stories and media to the
file-system, allowing another server to serve this content to
end-users.

This external server can be on same machine as Krang or on another
machine which is able to read from the configured preview and publish
paths (by NFS, for example).

For example, if I setup a site with:

  URL:          www.foo.com
  Preview URL:  preview.foo.com
  Publish Path: /www/foo
  Preview Path: /www/preview.foo

Then I could setup a copy of Apache with this vhost configuration to
serve the live and preview sites:

  <VirtualHost *>
     ServerName www.foo.com
     DocumentRoot /www/foo
  </VirtualHost>

  <VirtualHost *>
     ServerName preview.foo.com
     DocumentRoot /www/preview.foo
  </VirtualHost>

Of course, you'll probably want to put access control on your preview
server to keep non-editors out, but that is beyond the scope of this
document.  For more information on configuring Apache see
http://httpd.apache.org .  Of course, you're not limited to using
Apache to serve Krang-generated content.  Any web server will work!

To test your preview and publish setup, create a story and add some
content.  Try previewing the story.  Then try publishing the story and
entering the URL for the story in your browser's location bar.  If you
got the story both times, you're done!

=head2 Adding Categories

After adding a site the next step is to create some categories within
the new site.  Categories are analgous to directories on a
file-system.  Stories, Media and Templates are created within
categories.  The category of a Story or Media determines the first
part of its URL.  For example, a Story with the slug 'weekend_update'
within the category 'foo.com/news' would have the URL
'foo.com/news/weekend_update'.

Every site has at least one category which is created when the site is
created - the root category.  The root category is special in that it
doesn't have a directory name; its URL is simply the site URL with a
trailing '/'.

To add a new category, go to the 'Categories' application within the
'Admin' section of the navigation bar.  Click on 'Add a Category' and
you'll see the interface in Figure 2.
