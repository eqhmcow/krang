To build Krang from source on Debian 5.02 (Lenny) you need to
install the following deb packages (as root, of course):

  aptitude install \
    libperl-dev \
    libmysqlclient15-dev \
    libexpat1-dev \
    libjpeg62-dev \
    libungif4-dev \
    libpng12-dev 
    
After that ./bin/krang_build && ./bin/krang_install as
detailed in the INSTALL file.
