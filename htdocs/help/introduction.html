<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Krang is a web-accessible application that will provide your staff with the ability to easily create, manage and publish website and email content. Krang creates a website that can be tailored to your specific needs, enabling you to provide the right content to your target audience.
</p>

<p>
To use Krang, you don't need to be an HTML producer or programmer - you need only a basic understanding of Internet usage. It is recommended that new users contact the site administrator for Krang training first, and then refer to the manual as questions arise.
</p>
