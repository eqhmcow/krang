Instead of uploading individual pieces of Media one by one, Media can also be Bulk Uploaded, in other words, multiple files can be uploaded at one time.<br><br>

Bulk Upload works in different ways depending on the browser/OS system you are working on.<br><br>

If you are using Internet Explorer, click on the FTP Upload link. An FTP client will be launched automatically. Navigate for the files on your computer, then transfer them to your Media file system.<br><br>

For all other browsers, use the Archive Upload. Click on <i>Browse</i> to find a .zip or .sit file on your computer. Then select a Site/Category. Then click on <i>Upload</i>.<br><br>

When the Upload process is finished all Media will appear in the PIRT CMS. Go to Find Media to search for a particular file.<br><br>
