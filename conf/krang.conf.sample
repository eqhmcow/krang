# This variable controls the character-set for Krang's user interface.
# Compliant browsers will use this setting to encode data they send to
# Krang.  NOTE: If your editors use IE 6 on Windows XP and may copy
# non-ASCII data into Krang then you may need to set this to either
# "windows-1252" or "utf-8" to work-around a bug in IE 6.
#
Charset utf-8

#
# This variable controls whether Krang uses SSL.  You must compile
# Krang with --with-ssl before you can turn this on.
#
# EnableSSL 1

#
# You can change the default SSL port with this directive.
#
# SSLApachePort 443

#
# This variable controls whether Krang uses SSL for links to preview.
# This is independent of EnableSSL, allowing you to run your preview
# server with SSL enabled even if Krang is not using SSL.

# ContactEmail provides an optional way for you to specify how

# It will place into the UI templates to fill the 'cms_contact_email'

# Localization directives
#
# If none is specified the English default is used
#
# DefaultLanguage is used on the login screen and if the user has
#                 not yet specified his language preference
#
# AvailableLanguages figure in the language selector on the 'Preferences' screen
#
# These are RFC3066-style language tags telling Krang which
# dictionaries in lang/ it should make use of.  Make sure you've got
# the appropriate lexicon files. For the English default, you just need
#      lang/messages.en
# For other languages you need
#      lang/messages.LANG-TAG
#      lang/perl.LANG-TAG
#      lang/javascript.LANG-TAGB
#
#DefaultLanguage de
#AvailableLanguages en de

#
# The three optional variables below limit the number of versions
# saved in the database for Story, Media, and Template objects.
# The default for each is 0, meaning all versions are kept. 
#
# For Stories, specific classes may override the universal
# value via a method called versions_to_keep() (see TopLevel.pm)
#
# For Media, versions refer to the metadata associated with
# a media file, and not the file itself (of which only the latest
# copy is kept, in the file system rather than the database).
#
# NOTE: Changing one of these variables does not automatically
# prune existing versions from the database - to do that, you
# must run the script /bin/krang_prune_versions
#
# SavedVersionsPerMedia 0
# SavedVersionsPerStory 0
# SavedVersionsPerTemplate 0

# This directive determines the maximum number of items allowed to
# live in the trashbin.  When this limit is reached and exceeded, the
# oldest items get deleted.
