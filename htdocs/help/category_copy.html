<h2>Copy Category</h2>
<p>
Here you may copy the content of one category and its subcategories to
another category and determine what exactly you want to copy. The
category you copy from has been selected when you clicked on the
<i>Copy</i> button on the previous screen.  

Next you have to determine <i>where</i> you want to copy to and
<i>what</i> you want to copy along with the subcategories.

<ul>
<li><b>Category Copying To:</b> Using the usual category chooser,
select the category you want to copy to.</li>

<li><b>Copy Stories?</b> Check this option if the copy should include
stories living below
<i>Category Copying From</i>.</li>

<li><b>Copy Media?</b> Check this option if the copy should include
media living below
<i>Category Copying From</i>.</li>

<li><b>Copy Templates?</b> Check this option if the copy should
include templates living below
<i>Category Copying From</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <b>Overwrite Existing Files</b> checkbox modifies the copy
behavior:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Without Overwrite:</b> If the URL of a would-be-copied Story,
Media or Template is already occupied by some other Story, Media or
Template, Krang will ask you whether you want to cancel the whole copy
operation or copy at least the non-conflicting Stories, Media and
Templates.</li>

<li><b>With Overwrite:</b> In this case, Krang will move conflicting
Stories, Media and Templates to the Trash, in order to make place for
the copy.
</li>
</ul>
