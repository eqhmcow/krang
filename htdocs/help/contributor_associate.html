<h2>Associate Contributor</h2>
<p>
Each Story/Media can be associated with a contributor(s). These contributors can be writers, photographers, etc. Entering contributors into the system is a separate process. Please refer to <a href="help.pl?topic=contributor" class="helplink">Contributors</a> for more information. After clicking <i>Edit Contributors</i> on the Edit Story/Media screen, to associate a contributor, check the box next to the contributor you want to associate, then click the <i>Associate</i> button. Click <i>Return</i> to return to the Edit Story/Media page.<br><br>

In addition to associating a contributor, you can also search for a contributor, add a contributor, reorder or un-associate the contributor.
