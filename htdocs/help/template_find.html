<h2>Find Templates - Advanced/Simple</h2>
<p>
Use Find Templates to search Krang for Templates. By using search terms and keywords, you can run specific searches for individual or multiple templates.
</p>

<p>
There are two Find Template interfaces.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Simple:</b> The default search is very simple: just enter a title, URL or keyword and click <i>Search</i>. (To include the actual content of templates in your search, click 'Search full text?') For a complete list of Templates, leave the space blank and click <i>Search</i>.</li>
<li><b>Advanced:</b> This search allows you to be more specific about the Template you're trying to find. Fill in any or all of the fields and click <i>Search</i>. To restart your search with a fresh page, click <i>Clear</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After completing your search and finding the template you are looking for, you can Edit, Check Out, View, or Delete the Template.
</p>

<b>Note Regarding Full-Text Searches</b><br>
Phrases can be put in quotation marks if you wish to find Stories that contain the whole phrase rather than the individual words. Also, although the default search matches partial words, you can request full-word matches only by quoting the text and including whitespace - for example, " word " will not match "wordsmith", but will match "word" even if it appears at the beginning or end of a sentence.
