Krang has been tested on clean Mandrake 9.2 "Everything"
install.  Before you install Krang you'll need to install MySQL 4.
You can find the MySQL 4 RPMs here:

  http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html

Install the server, client, devel and shared RPMs.  After that you
should be ready to run krang_install.  See INSTALL for details.

NOTE: On Mandrake 9.2 Krang is setup to start on boot, via a link to
bin/krang_ctl placed in /etc/init.d and activated using chkconfig.

If you want to build Krang from a source distribution (ex:
krang-1.013-src.tar.gz), you'll need the following RPMs installed.
You can find them on your installation CDs or at a Mandrake mirror
