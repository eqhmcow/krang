My Preferences is the page where you can set certain system preferences for items in the PIRT CMS. 'My Preferences' are specific to each individual user and can only be accessed by the logged in user. As new features are added to the CMS, the My Preferences page will change to include more functions. At this time, the following functions are available:<br><br>


1)	Search Results/Page
2)	Change Password

<span class="helpsubhead">Search Results/Page</span><br>
This function enables you do decide the maximum number of items listed in a search result or in a list on a page. You can select anywhere between 5 and 95. This will affect how many items are displayed on your screen at any one time when you conduct a search or when you access a page that displays a list of items.<br>
<br>

<span class="helpsubhead">Change Password </span><br>
You can change your password on the 'My Preferences' page. Enter your New Password in the available text field, then enter it again in the second text field, and click on Commit Changes. The next time you login, you will have to use your new password.<br><br>
