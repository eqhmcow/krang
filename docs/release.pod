=head2 What release will do

=over 4

=item Tag CVS

Based on the version in Krang.pm, all the files in the release will be
tagged.  Tag names are derived from the version number by replacing
"." with "_", and pre-pending a "V", e.g., 

  Version: 1.23
  CVS Tag: V1_23

If you forget to update the $VERSION in Krang.pm, the release system
will detect that the tag already exists and will abort.


=item Create tar-ball

At the end of the build process, a file will be created in the format:

  krang-XX.YY.tar.gz

Where XX.YY is the version of teh release.  For example, version 1.23 would result in a file:

  krang-1.23.tar.gz

This is the distribution tarball which should be released to PIRT.
