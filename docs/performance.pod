=head1 Krang Performance Tests

=head2 Introduction

This document provides the results of performance tests performed on
Krang.

These tests were run a dual-P4/2.8Ghz machine with 4GB of RAM.  MySQL
was tuned to use XGB of memory.  

The content used in the tests was randomly generated to simulate the
contents of a typical Krang instance.  The content used is similar to
that generated with the krang_floodfill script included with Krang.
