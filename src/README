This directory contains the files necessary to re-build Krang's
required external sub-systems and libraries from source.  These
external assets currently include:

        1. Apache/mod_perl web server
        2. Open source Perl modules

It is not usually necessary to rebuild from source, as all these
assets are provided in compiled form in the /krang/apache/ and
/krang/lib/ directories, respectively.  The files in this directory
are provided only in the case of some unforseen necessity, such as
disaster recovery or migration to a new operating system or hardware
architecture.

It is expected that as new Perl modules or other external resources
are added, their tarballed source trees will be added to this
directory.

Following are a list of the required Perl modules, in order of
prerequisite.  For Perl module installation instructions, please refer
to the install.pod found in the docs directory.
