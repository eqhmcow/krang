<h2>Find Media - Advanced/Simple</h2>
<p>
Use Find Media to search Krang for live media. By using search terms and keywords, 
you can run specific searches for individual or multiple media.
</p>

<p>
There are two Find Media interfaces.
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Simple:</b> The default search is very simple: just enter a
title, URL or keyword and click <i>Search</i>. For a complete list of
Media, leave the space blank and click <i>Search</i>.</li>

<li><b>Advanced:</b> This search allows you to be more specific about
the Media you're trying to find. Fill in any or all of the fields and
click <i>Search</i>. To restart your search with a fresh page, click
<i>Clear</i>.<br/>

When searching by Media ID, you may also find archived or trashed
media.  For archived media the status column will indicate 'Archive',
for trashed media, 'Trash'.

</li>
</ul>

<p>
After completing your search and finding the Media you are looking
for, you can View, Edit, Archive, Check Out, Publish or Delete the
Media (depending on your permission set).
</p>

<p>
If you didn't find what you are looking for, you may click <i>Search
in Archive</i> to start the same search in the Archive.
