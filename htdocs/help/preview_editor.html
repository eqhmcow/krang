<h2>Preview Editor</h2>

<p>
Krang's Preview Editor provides links from the previewed story back
into the Krang CMS interface. For one, it allows to easily find the
templates participating in the generation of the previewed story, for
two it provides links to jump back into the Story Edit interface.
</p>

<h3>Interface</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Browse:</b> The default browse mode allows you to browse around
as usual, keeping links activated.</li>

<li><b>Find Template:</b> You will see this button if you have at
least READ permission for templates. Click anywhere on the screen to
display an info window showing information about the templates
participating in the creation of the story. The first template in the
list is the template responsible for creating the portion of the page
you clicked upon. The second template (if present in the list) is the
one that includes the first one, the third includes the second
etc.<br/>

Clicking on a template link in the info window will open
Krang's <i>Find Template</i> screen in another window or tab, with the
search results list showing only the corresponding template.</li>

<li><b>Edit Story:</b> Clicking this button will show link overlays
for each container element of the previewed story. These overlays
roughly appear where the content of the corresponding element begins
on the page.  A click on those label will open the element on the
"Edit Story" screen in the browser window/tab that initiated the
preview. This allows you the quickly jump to a deeply nested element
saving you from the trouble to "drill down" on the element tree.</li>

<li><b>Steal from someUserName:</b> The story is currently
checked out by another user, but you may steal it for editing.
Clicking on this button will show the same link overlays providing the
functionality previously described.</li>

<li><b>Checked out by someUserName:</b> The story is checked out by
another user and you may not steal it. The button is replaced by a
simple message.</li>

<li><b>No Edit Permission:</b> You do not have the edit permissions
for this story.</li>

<li><b>Close:</b> Leave the Preview Editor. The top overlay will
disappear, returning to a classical story preview with no additional
functionality. The only way to bring Preview Editor back is through
one of Krang's story preview links.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Note</b> that in "Find Template" and in "Edit/Steal Story" mode the
normal link behavior is deactivated.</p>
