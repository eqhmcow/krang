=head1 Upgrading Krang

To upgrade an existing Krang installation, first unpack the new
version of Krang and enter the created directory

  $ tar zxvf krang-1.013-Redhat7_3-perl5.6.1-i686-linux.tar.gz
  $ cd krang-1.013-Redhat7_3-perl5.6.1-i686-linux

Then, as root, run the Krang upgrade script:

  # ./bin/krang_upgrade

If Krang isn't installed in C</usr/local/krang> then you'll need to
point C<krang_upgrade> in the right direction:

  # ./bin/krang_upgrade --krangRoot /path/to/krang/install
