<h2>New Story</h2>

<p>
Within Krang, all written content is considered a Story. Whether it's a feature article or your web site's Homepage, using this tool will get you started creating new content.
</p>

<p>
Each Story that is created in Krang will have unique elements and specific features that you pick and choose from as you build your Story.
</p>

<p>
The first items associated with a Story are the properties that you select/enter on the 'New Story' page.
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Type:</b> Type refers to your Story Type. Select the type of Story you'd like to create, such as Feature Article. Story Type is a required field.</li>
<li><b>Title:</b> This is the Title of your Story. Depending on the Story Type it may appear directly in the output. The Title is a required field.</li>
<li><b>Slug:</b> The slug is a one-word identifier used as the last part of the Story's URI, and the directory in which the story resides. Some Story Types require a slug. For those that do not, you may choose to make a Story a Category Index by checking the box to the right of the slug field. The URL of the Category plus the slug (if any) form the complete URL of the Story, which must be unique.</li>
<li><b>Cover Date:</b> When creating a New Story, select a Cover Date. The cover Date defaults to the current date and time, but it can be modified to a future or previous date. The cover date is a required field and may appear on some Story Types directly in the URL or the page.</li>
<li><b>Site/Category:</b> Every Story must be located in a site and category. Clicking the <i>Choose</i> button will launch a menu tree where you can find the correct category. From the menu tree click <i>OK</i> to accept your choice and close the function or <i>Cancel</i> to return to the New Story page.</li>
</ul>

<p>
After the above information is entered, click on <i>Create</i>, this will take you to the next step in Creating a New Story.
</p>

<p>
<i>Reset</i> and <i>Cancel</i> are also available. Resetting will delete all text from the text boxes on this page. Cancelling will return you to My Workspace and not Save any of the information entered.
